<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE name of Joseph Wright, of Derby, once of high repute among English
Artists, has, during the last half-century and more, sunk, altogether
undeservedly, into a state of semi-oblivion. The Exhibition at Derby
in 1883 did, indeed, something to restore its fame, and it is to be
hoped that the present work may do yet more. Both book and exhibition
owe their existence mainly to the exertions of Mr. Bemrose, who in this
matter may be said to have been moved by a triple love&mdash;the love of
art, the love of family, and the love of locality. By his kindness I
am allowed here to aid in doing justice to an artist of whom not only
Derby, but England, should be proud.</p>

<p>Even if such a feat were possible, I should have no wish to compare
accurately the merits of Wright with those of his forerunners and
contemporaries. It will, however, be generally acknowledged that
between such names as Hogarth, Reynolds, Gainsborough, and Wilson, and
such as West, Northcote, Barry, and Hamilton, there is a gap&mdash;sensibly
to be felt. In this gap, but nearer to the greater than to the lesser
men, a place has of late years been found for Romney. It is but a
modest claim for Wright that the same distinction should be accorded to
him.</p>

<p>As a painter, his method, in relation to that of Reynolds and
Gainsborough, may be said to have been old-fashioned. His pure, precise
touches, his level surface, and clear enamelled colours, have not,
indeed, the variety of texture or the inspired freedom of a Franz
Hals. His practice was nearer to that of Van der Helst, and a host of
other illustrious artists to whom clear, clean, work was dear. Through
Kneller, and Hogarth, and Hudson, it came to him from Holland; and if
he did not reform it, he mastered it, and left his mark upon it. As a
colourist, he was scarcely an innovator; but he was still less of a
copyist. In this and most other respects a “naturalist,” he did not
allow a preference for certain harmonies to dominate his work; but
though his colour missed the charm of inspiration, it never failed in
harmony. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> had the colour sense, and a command of the whole scale.
In his candle-light pieces the prevailing hues were determined by his
subject; but the way in which he united the blazing reds and yellows
of the central glare to the rich browns of his transparent shadows,
warmed and cooled these shadows with gleams of red coat and glimmers
of blue sash and white dress, and from the ruddy glow of the chamber
to the cool night outside, led the eye, untired, showed rare taste,
as well as skill. If we take his portraits by ordinary light, we find
the same fine power. The group of Mr. Newton’s children, with its blue
boy, its olive-green boy, and its girl in white and gold, set off with
rich green foliage and clusters of ripe cherries, is a masterpiece
of colour. In these daylight portraits, all the favourite colours
of the dress of the period are introduced and reconciled. The hues
and textures of the buff waistcoat, the “nankeen” breeches, the puce
slip, the cinnamon coat, and the pink shoes, are imitated with the
same sure skill, the same artistic impartiality. Only in regard to one
colour do we find a decided preference, and this is neither the blue
of Gainsborough nor the red of Reynolds, but what may be called the
green of Wright. Probably no other artist has treated this colour with
such variety. It tinges those bladders of which he was so fond; we
find it lightly in the stone-coloured coat of Mr. Cheslyn, and deeply
in the arm of his chair; in pale cucumber the artist robed his pitiful
“Maria”; and from that fine picture of himself in the National Portrait
Gallery we learn that it was green that he elected to wear in his youth
when he wished to look particularly spruce.</p>

<p>Of his effects of artificial light there is the less need to speak,
since what reputation he now preserves is founded upon them. The
engravings after Wright by Earlom, J. R. Smith, Val. Green, Pether,
and others, are still sought after, and the “Air Pump” is in the
National Gallery for all who wish to see. It may, however, be doubted
whether due recognition has, as yet, been given to the largeness of
design and the dignified simplicity of pose and gesture which lend an
almost classic style to such pictures as “The Orrery,” “The Air Pump,”
and “The Gladiator.” The Exhibition of 1883, while it confirmed
the reputation of such pictures, showed also that his rank as a
portrait painter was much higher than was supposed. In this branch of
art we find him submitting himself to his subject, and seeking rather
to express than to adorn it. He brings you, as few artists do, into
the presence of his sitters. As if alone and at ease, unconscious of
observation, they, whether men, women, or children, are all engaged
with their own thoughts and employments, just as they might have been
seen any day in library or garden. Many men of celebrity, not only
local, he painted&mdash;Arkwright and Whitehurst, Darwin and Strutt; but
the charm of his portraits does not depend on the fame of the sitter,
but on the power of the artist to seize a distinct individuality,
and to make each likeness for ever interesting as an authentic image
of a fellow-man. Unsophisticated by fashion or affectation, Wright’s
portraits are history in its simplest and truest form.</p>

<p>Of the pure charm of his children, some of the illustrations to this
volume, especially Mr. Seymour Haden’s painter-like etching of the
“Twins,” will speak. Sir Joshua painted children with more spirit and
with a livelier eye for fleeting charms of expression; but no artist
has painted them more freshly and truly than Wright. Another admirably
suggestive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> etching by Mr. Haden shows us the elegance of mien and
grace of sentiment which he could infuse into his more poetical
designs. His versatility was remarkable; but his culture, partly,
perhaps, on account of his secluded life, partly from his ill-health,
left many of his faculties undeveloped, and his imagination was crossed
by a vein of ingenuity which made him delight rather in resolving
problems than in indulging fancy. Nevertheless, the “Minstrel” and the
“Maria” are as good reflections as exist of that somewhat thin but
elegant strain of poetic sentiment which was in vogue in his day. He
has in these pictures preserved its gentleness and grace without its
falseness. A deeper note of pathos (and pathos unstrained) is touched
in the once famous “Dead Soldier.” In his “Death and the Woodman” we
find extreme terror depicted with all the force of the most modern
realist; and if he did not&mdash;(who did?)&mdash;prove himself equal to the
interpretation of Shakespeare, there is in Boydell’s Gallery no finer
head than that of his “Prospero.”</p>

<p>It will seem strange to many that Wright should in his day have ranked
even higher as a landscape painter than as a painter of men, but his
fireworks and conflagration effects were a novelty, and were executed
with a skill which must have then seemed astonishing. Now, perhaps,
even if they were done with the superior genius of a Turner, we should
not care overmuch for them. His more ordinary scenes from nature were
sometimes almost as good as Wilson’s, but generally wanted the warmth
and the air of that fine artist, and his composition was apt to be too
palpably ingenious.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, all abatement made, he was an original and able landscape
painter, and when we add this to his other claims, and remember how
thoroughly sincere his art was, how distinct his personality, it seems
hard that the latest History of English Art should not even mention
his name. True, it was written by a foreigner; and it is probable that
if M. Chesneau had visited Derby two years ago he would have awarded
Wright an honourable place among those artists whom he calls the Old
Masters of England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="smcap center p-left">The Family of Wright.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-j.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">Joseph Wright, like his famous contemporaries, Reynolds and Wilson,
belonged to the great middle-class, as may be seen from the pedigree
appended to this chapter. Wright could reckon amongst his progenitors
men of some consideration in the three professions of Law, Physic,
and Divinity. The family appears to have settled at Seighford, Co.
Stafford, in 1662, and from thence to have migrated, about the year
1673, to Longford in Derbyshire. The earliest ancestor of Wright whom
I have been able to trace is the great-grandfather of the painter, and
I am indebted to the Rev. J. Charles Cox, LL.D., the present Rector
of Enville, Stourbridge, for the following interesting information
respecting him.</p>

<p>On February 17th, 1662, in the Rectory House of S. Andrew, Holborn,
Bishop Hacket (of Coventry and Lichfield) instituted “Johannes Wright,
clericus,” into the vicarage of Seighford, Staff., vacant through death
of last incumbent, on presentation of the King.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>On the 5th of the same month, at an ordination held in the Parish
Church of S. Andrew, Holborn, by the same Bishop Hacket, “Johēs Wright,
e Colleg, Dublin, in Regno Hiberiæ,” was ordained priest.</p>

<p>On September 12th, 1671, Bishop Wood instituted Jno. Nash to the
vicarage of Seighford, on the resignation of John Wright.</p>

<p>On leaving Seighford, the Rev. John Wright became Rector of Longford,
Co. Derby, where he died in 1681. His death is thus recorded in the
Parish Register, “1681. John Wright, rector of Longford, an orthodox
and worthy son. Buried January 10th.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>This exemplary clergyman left a widow and eight children. The maiden
name of the former I have not been able to discover, but her Christian
name was Elizabeth, and those of his surviving children (he had lost
one, Sarah, during her childhood) are written on the back of the
inventory of his goods, thus&mdash;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Richard.</li>
  <li>John.</li>
  <li>Thomas.</li>
  <li>Jonathan.</li>
  <li>Matthewe.</li>
  <li>Elizabeth.</li>
  <li>Mary.</li>
  <li>Bridget.</li>
</ul>

<p>Letters of Administration were taken out on the 28th June, 1682, and
some of the items of the inventory are so interesting as to be worth
transcribing. It is to be remarked, in the first place, that his goods
were valued at the low total sum of £205, and that the largest item was
for “corn, wheat, pease, and oates, £44,” from which, and from other
entries, it may be inferred that he farmed his own glebe. Among the
latter may be quoted&mdash;</p>

<p>Of the modest establishment and simple habits of this country parson
of the 17th century this document affords evidence. His “plate” was
estimated at £5 only, and the same sum was considered sufficient to
represent the value of his “purse and apparell,” while the worth of the
whole furniture of his “parlour,” consisting of “15 chairs, 2 tables,
1 carpet,” is set down at £3. That he was studious, as well as simple,
is attested by the comparatively large valuation of the contents of his
“studdy.” These were “one desk and lock, and shelves and books,” which
were assessed at £30 4s.&mdash;a sum exceeding the supposed equivalent in
money of the entire furniture of the Rectory. This assertion I must
ask my readers to take upon trust, as the inventory of the contents of
the kitchen, dairy, brewhouse, and five upper chambers is scarcely of
sufficient interest to print <i>in extenso</i>.</p>

<p>Of the nine children of the Rev. John Wright, of Seighford and
Longford, some information is given in the pedigree; but here we need
concern ourselves only with his sons, Richard and John, from whom
sprang two distinct branches of the family. It is from John that the
subject of our biography is descended, but Richard claims precedence by
right of seniority.</p>

<p>Of this eldest son, Richard, little is known, except that he was born
at Loaden Hall, (or Leadenhall), Pentridge, Staffordshire, in 1662,
and that he was the father of Richard Wright, M.D., of Derby. This,
the second Richard of this branch, was born in 1702, and was twice
married&mdash;firstly, to Dorothy Gell, of Wirksworth, who died childless;
and, secondly, to Frances Wilcockson, of the same place, by whom he
had issue one son and two daughters. One of the daughters, Elizabeth,
died unmarried in 1766, and Mary, the other, became the wife of Captain
John Wilson, R.N., of Tamworth, and died in 1805. The son was named
Richard, after his father, and followed the same profession. The third
Richard in this branch was, like Joseph Wright the painter, the great
grandson of the Rector of Longford, and must not be confounded with
another Dr. Richard Wright, his second cousin, and brother of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
artist. For the sake of distinction he may be called Dr. Richard Wright
of London, where he settled and became distinguished. He was one of the
physicians to S. George’s Hospital, and being a man of high scientific
attainments, and a scholar of some eminence, he was elected a Fellow
of the Royal Society. He married Caroline, only surviving daughter of
Sir James Gray, by whom he had no issue. He collected one of the first
Libraries of his time, which, after his death, was sold by Messrs. T.
and J. Egerton, on Monday, April 23rd, 1787, and eleven following days.
This Library (which numbered 2,824 lots at the sale) consisted of an
elegant and extensive collection of books in every branch of learning;
it was particularly rich in works on History, Physic, Criticism, and
Divinity, and in Greek and Latin Classics. It also included many of the
scarcest editions of the old English Poets, novels, and romances, and a
remarkably singular assemblage of Theatrical literature, including the
rarest productions of the English drama. The dramatic works occupied
two days of the sale, and amongst other rarities were copies of the
first, second, third, and fourth editions of Shakespeare’s works. The
catalogue, a demy 8vo. of 102 pp., forms a good text book for the book
buyer of to-day. Dr. Wright died at his house, in Charles Street,
Grosvenor Square, London, on Saturday the 14th day of October, 1786.
His remains were brought to Derby, and interred in the family vault at
S. Michael’s Church.</p>

<p>It is now time to turn to the younger branch of the family to which our
artist belonged.</p>

<p>John, the second son of the Vicar of Seighford, and Rector of Longford,
was born at the former place in the year 1664. He became an attorney,
and established a reputation for integrity which descended to his son.
There is still in the possession of the family a letter, addressed to
him by “the great Lord Chesterfield,” dated April 13, 1704, in which
his Lordship says, “I am much satisfied to find that Mr. Thacker and my
daughter Wotton have employed in their affairs a character from whom
everybody may expect fair dealing.”</p>

<p>He married Anne Daykene in 1649, and had issue Jane, John, and
Elizabeth. John, the second, was born Jan. 16, 1697, and, like his
father, became an attorney of good repute. From his upright conduct
upon all occasions, he was known by the flattering name of “Equity
Wright.” It is said that when applied to respecting any case which
he thought only required explanation, it was his wont to reconcile
the parties as a friend, without making fee or charge. An attorney of
Derby, speaking of “Equity Wright,” some years after his death, said,
“he might have died very rich, had he acted like the generality of
his profession.” There can be no doubt that he was a thoroughly good
lawyer, for on more than one occasion, when he waited on the celebrated
Sir Eardley Wilmot, of Osmaston, for an opinion, Sir Eardley said to
him, “You are come to throw away a guinea with me, Mr. Wright, for you
know the law as well as I do.” He filled the office of Town Clerk of
Derby, from 1756 to 1765.</p>

<p>The sisters of “Equity Wright” died unmarried, but he, on September
26, 1728, took to wife a lady named Hannah Brookes, by whom he had
issue three sons and two daughters. John, the eldest, and third of this
name, was born August 29, 1729, and, like his father and grandfather,
became an attorney. He died March 22, 1798. Richard Wright, M.D., the
second son, already mentioned in the account of the elder branch of the
family, was born November 17,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> 1730, and attained some eminence as a
Physician in his native town, Derby. An old MS. has the following lines
relating to this Richard&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“Cease, wonders, cease, from this or that,</div>

        <div>Corners three and wig profound,</div>
        <div>He now salutes his friends all round.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>He married Sarah Wallis, of Derby, by whom he had two daughters, Hannah
and Anne. The latter married James Holworthy, an eminent artist, a
member of the old Society of Painters in Colours, and an intimate
friend of the late J. M. W. Turner, R.A. Mr. Holworthy purchased the
Brookfield Estate near Hathersage, and built Brookfield House. Hannah
died May 13, 1867, unmarried.</p>

“Nancy,” the youngest of the family, died unmarried in the years 1810

<p>Joseph Wright, the painter, commonly called Wright of Derby, to
distinguish him from another painter of the same surname,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was born
at Derby on the 3rd of September, 1734, in the house No. 28, Irongate,
and was educated at the Grammar School of that town, under the Rev. Mr.
Almond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the ordinary affix to Wright’s name has to some extent
interfered with his reputation, but the localisation of his fame is
also due to the fact that a great number of his paintings have always
remained in his native county, and in the possession of the families
for which they were painted.</p>

<p>He was truly “Wright <i>of Derby</i>.” For there he was born and educated,
and with the exception of three and a half years under Hudson, in
London, two years in Italy, and a similar period at Bath, we find
him located at Derby throughout his life. He was, however, well
patronised&mdash;perhaps, with the exception of Sir Joshua Reynolds, as much
so as any of his contemporaries, for seldom, if ever, did a painting
of his go into the hands of a dealer, or remain unsold. Respected
and honoured by his townsmen, and enjoying the close intimacy and
friendship of men eminent by their position and distinguished by their
talents in literature and art, he passed his days in the midst of those
he loved, industriously labouring at his profession, although at times
suffering from long periods of nervous depression until his death in
1797.</p>

<p>Wright’s friend and pupil, Mr. Jno. Moss Tate, of Liverpool, told
a gentleman who called upon him early in this century to see some
paintings by Wright in his possession, that “he was always pleased to
see a Derbyshire man, for that county had produced three most eminent
men in the sister arts&mdash;Chantrey, the sculptor, Wright, the painter,
and John Harrison, the singer.”</p>

<p>It is seldom that a better opportunity is found of obtaining a clear
insight into the working and every-day life of an artist, than that
afforded by the material collected for the present volume. This
consists principally of letters written, and memoranda made, long years
ago, and numerous notes by the artist himself. Most of the last are
contained in a book in which he carefully recorded the pictures he
painted, the prices he obtained for them, and the names of his patrons;
in it he was also wont to jot down memoranda (now full of interest)
relating to his family and private concerns. Personal and other relics,
religiously preserved by relatives, and handed down to the present day,
have also assisted in bringing before the writer a vivid picture of the
man and his doings.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Young Wright early manifested a taste for mechanics. His brother,
Richard, writing to a friend some years afterwards, thus alludes to
his leisure employments. “At an early time in life he showed great
propensity to knowledge in several mechanical branches; and being of
an active mind, would frequently spend his vacant time from school in
going to different shops to see the men work. When he returned home
he would imitate their works, and compleat them in a masterly manner,
such as joiner’s goods, chests of drawers, clocks, spinning wheels,
guns, etc. His genius afterwards turned to drawing and painting; if he
saw a person once he would draw the outlines of his face so strong as
to be known at sight; making great progress in those branches, he was
determined to pursue those studies for his profession; accordingly his
father, an Attorney-at-Law, enquired of his agents in London, who were
the most eminent masters, and upon enquiry he was recommended to Mr.
Hudson.”</p>

<p>Having seen a “raree show” at a fair, he considered attentively upon
what principle it could be formed, and having discovered the manner of
placing the glasses, completed a show about three feet high; having
done this, Wright went to the showman and told him he had made a show
like his. The man would not at first believe him, but upon enquiring
how he had made it, and finding it was quite correct, he earnestly
begged that the boy would not tell any one by what means he had
effected it. This show, exhibiting some Italian views, was afterwards
the delight of his children and nieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Scotch army, under Prince Charles Edward, came to Derby, in
December, 1745, the elder Mr. Wright, father of the painter, took his
wife, two daughters, and Joe, as he was generally called, to Repton,
thinking that the rebels could not cross the Trent, as there was no
bridge there at that time. During the preceding July his two eldest
sons, John and Richard, had been placed at Repton School, under the
Rev. Mr. Ashley. Much to the surprise of the Wrights, three officers
and forty men were quartered in their house at Derby. During the
soldiers’ stay they saw a small gun, with which they were so much
struck as to make enquiries respecting it, and upon being told that
it was made by Master Joseph, “they wished they could see the little
gentleman, they would take him with them, for they were sure he must be
an ingenious boy to make that gun.”</p>

<p>At Repton, young Wright saw a “Christmas-Piece” which belonged to one
of the boys. For a long time this piece so engrossed his mind that he
could think of nothing else, and he dwelt upon it until he determined
to try to draw. Thus at eleven years of age he took to art, and
gradually left off his mechanical pursuits. This love for mechanics
showed itself later in life, by the introduction of an air pump and an
orrery into two of his principal pictures. He likewise invented a pair
of proportional compasses. These were made of two strips of wood, with
an opening down the middle of each, placed upon each other and united
by a screw, which, moving up and down, fixed the point of the compasses
at any place that was desired. By this instrument Wright was enabled to
accurately enlarge or diminish any drawing.</p>

<p>His father being averse to his devoting so much time to drawing,
thinking it would never be of use to him, and might withdraw his
attention from more necessary pursuits, young Wright used to draw,
unknown to his friends, in an attic, where he spent much of his spare
time. Having nothing from which to study, he copied the public-house
signs in the town, which at that time exhibited more “pictures” than at
the present day, and it is related of him, that when he had completed
his copy of the sign of “Robin Hood and Little John,” near his father’s
residence, he was highly delighted, as he was likewise when he had
finished the “Buck in the Park.” The “Buck in the Park”&mdash;a sign by
which an inn in the town is still known at the present day&mdash;means the
arms of the Borough of Derby, which are <i>azure</i>, a buck couchant,
enclosed in park-palings, all <i>proper</i>. His method was, after looking
long and earnestly at the sign, to go home and draw as much as he could
remember of it. When at a loss, he returned and examined the sign,
and then ran back as rapidly as possible, so that he might not lose
the impression produced on his mind, and thus he continued until the
drawing was finished. His mother, noticing his conduct, and wishing
to know why he spent so much time in the attic spoken of, entered it
and discovered his employment. The boy-artist earnestly begged that
she would not tell his father, and this request, fortunately for the
world, was granted. His predilection for art is well illustrated by a
life-size head of Counsellor Noel, in my possession, drawn upon blue
paper in black and white crayons; on the back, in Wright’s handwriting,
“Jos Wright, fecit September 3rd, 1751, Ætat 17. Counsellor Noell. The
head being unfinished I was obliged to leave it so.” There is little
doubt he was in the habit of attending the Courts of Assize with his
father, who was engaged there professionally, and had amused himself by
sketching the counsellor in his wig, but from some cause had not time
to finish it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The sketches of his early boyhood show considerable skill and power in
light and shade, and the treatment of drapery, and are thus prophetic
of that command of <i>chiar-oscuro</i> which distinguished the pictures of
his maturity.</p>

<p>His delight in strong lights and shadows was very conspicuous
throughout his life. He could never pass a blacksmith’s shop, or any
striking lights in the streets, without staying to study them; and the
influence of this early passion of his is seen in a large number of his
paintings, where remarkable fire, candle-light, and atmospheric effects
are rendered with singular power and truth.</p>

<p>At length his father, finding his decided turn for painting, determined
upon placing him with the most eminent artist of the time; and in 1751,
when Joseph was seventeen years of age, he, after careful enquiry
amongst his friends in London, placed him with Hudson,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the portrait
painter, with whom he remained as a student for two years. Wright,
however, appears to have soon become dissatisfied with the subjects
which Hudson gave him to copy, which, if we may judge from the studies
of this period still existing&mdash;stiff, formal portraits in black and
white chalk upon blue paper&mdash;was not to be wondered at; amongst them is
a spirited resemblance of himself, and it is thought probable that the
artist, tired of such copying, amused himself by studying from nature.</p>

<p>Young Wright, like most young men, was fond of a frolic, but the effect
of a practical joke which he played at Hudson’s effectually cured him
of these mischievous propensities. It appears that the lay-figure at
Hudson’s was upon low wheels, and having tied a piece of string to it,
which he conveyed under the door, Wright, the next morning, whilst the
servant-maid was cleaning the grate, stationed himself at the door,
which was a little open, to amuse himself with her surprise at seeing
it move. Having waited his opportunity, he gently pulled the string,
and when the girl turned to look, suddenly stopped. She took no further
notice of it until he drew it more decidedly steadily forward. She
then earnestly watched its progress, and at last, being convinced that
it was moving, threw down her brush and rushed out of the room, and
would, in her fright, have precipitated herself over the rails of the
stairs, if he had not caught her. He was so much alarmed when he saw
how greatly she was agitated, and thought what would have been the
probable consequence of such a fall, that he determined never again to
indulge in practical jokes, a resolution which he seems never to have
forgotten. This circumstance made such an impression upon his mind,
that he could not hear with patience of any attempt to frighten people,
as “there was no knowing to what consequences it might lead.”</p>

<p>Upon the expiration of the period for which he had been placed with
Hudson, Wright, at the age of nineteen, returned to Derby, and soon
afterwards painted the portraits of his father and mother, his two
sisters, his brother, and himself. These were probably the first
portraits he painted, as, when they sat to him, he had only&mdash;it must
be remembered&mdash;been two years at his profession. At this time he also
painted the portraits of many of his friends, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> members of the
principal families in the neighbourhood. Being, however, dissatisfied
with his progress, he returned to London, in 1756, to study under
Hudson for the second time, and remained with him for fifteen months,
often lamenting during that period that he could not obtain better
instruction, there being no master of eminence in England at that time.</p>

<p>Painting was not Wright’s only pursuit. He was a real lover of music,
and was considered by those able to judge to be a first-rate amateur
performer upon the flute, which he was taught by Tacet. Mr. Denby,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
the organist at All Saints’ Church, at this time had weekly concerts at
his house, at which Wright played the flute, Burdett (who published a
Map of Derbyshire in 1767) the violoncello, the Rev. Mr. Hope “thorough
bass on the harpsichord,” and the Rev. Mr. Blackwall and Mr. Charles
Denby first and second violins. These were cheerful evenings, and
Wright took a prominent part in the mirth, for, though naturally shy
and retiring, he was of a social and lively disposition. He is said
to have been the life of the party. He also attended the balls and
assemblies<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in Derby, Newark, Chesterfield, and other places, and
from his handsome person and pleasant manners was a general favourite.
An old inhabitant of Derby, Mr. Haden, used to relate that Wright
once asked him whether he should teach him to draw, or to play on the
flute, and that he foolishly chose the latter. Wright, he said, was
a very pleasant master, who held the agreeable theory that Madeira
was the best medicine for the flute, and never gave him a lesson
without ordering in a bottle of it. Mrs. Cade (Wright’s daughter) has
related that he used to play upon the flute in the evening, after he
had prepared his palette for the next day; and that the Rev. Thomas
Gisborne (who then resided in St. Helen’s House, at the top of Bridge
Gate, and afterwards at Yoxall Lodge, Needwood Forest) was in the habit
of drawing with him in the morning, and playing upon the flute with him
in the evening. She also recollected going with him to Darley Grove,
adjoining St. Helen’s, where he delighted to hear the echoes to his
flute.</p>

<p>After Wright’s death, there was found a large box containing music for
the flute, written very neatly by himself, which at last came to the
ignominious fate of being used by the servants for lighting the fires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>An early memorandum of Wright’s states:&mdash;“My Father paid Sandys the
colourman for me Mch 1759, £15. 17. 0. In March 1762 paid ditto £20.
14. 0. Lent me a guinea to send W<sup>ri.</sup> Paid for cloth for shirts when
I was in London £4. 4. 0. For a German Flute £3. 3. 0.”</p>

<p>Having soon attained some local celebrity, Wright was allowed a room
at the Town Hall when he wished to exhibit his pictures, and could
not show them to advantage at his father’s. It was in this room that
he painted the portraits of the members of the Derby Hunt, which now
hang in Markeaton Hall, where they were placed by Francis Noel Clarke
Mundy, the poet. This gentleman, from an elegy written by him in 1765,
appears to have been “The life, the leader of the hunter train,” and
in Wright’s MS. book occurs the following memorandum in connection
with a portrait of one of the Mundy family: “The letter in Mr. Mundy’s
picture to be dated from Amberley, in Sussex. It must conclude with
‘your friend Harry Deckham,’ not Henry. The case upon the letter table,
directed to Francis Mundy, Esq., at Markeaton, near Derby.” Amongst
the portraits known to have been exhibited at the Town Hall may be
mentioned that of “Old John,” head waiter at the King’s Head Inn, which
was raffled for ten guineas, and won by Danl. Parker Coke, Esq. This
picture, which represents “Old John,” with roses in the button-hole
of his coat, and a smiling and intelligent face under his wig, is now
in the possession of Lord Belper. Another local character similarly
distinguished, was Thomas Oliver, beadle at All Saints’ Church,
whose attentive attitude, whilst Mr. Winter or his curate, Mr. Hope,
preached, had caught the artist’s eye. The interest thus excited led
the artist to obtain a sitting from the beadle, and the picture which
resulted was exhibited at the Town Hall. Wright made a crayon drawing
of this portrait, and gave it to Mr. Denby.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">It is interesting to note in the life of an artist who showed such
varied talents, at what periods he entered on the different walks of
art, which he trod with such success. We know that Wright painted
portraits only whilst under Hudson’s tuition; and even for several
years after his second period of study under that master, which was
during the year 1756, he seems to have attempted nothing else. We are
also able to all but fix the dates of many of his early candle-light
and historical subjects, because they were exhibited at the rooms of
the Society of Artists.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The first of these appeared in 1765, and was
called “Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> by Candle-light.” In the
same way we can fix approximately the date of his first landscape as
1772.</p>

<p>From such records we may also conclude with some certainty that it was
Wright’s own innate genius that impelled him to study those effects of
artificial light with which his name is so strongly associated, for
hitherto no English painter had attempted them, and he did not leave
England till 1773.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>His visit to Italy, in 1774&ndash;5, where he saw a grand Eruption of
Vesuvius, merely turned his natural predilection for strange effects of
light into a new channel. This eruption may be said to have been the
father of his numerous landscapes of volcanoes and conflagrations. Of
the eruption alone he painted about eighteen pictures, each of which
was treated in a manner differing more or less from the rest. In his
striking pictures of sun and moonlight, which also began about this
time, we see the same love for unusual and powerful effects of light.</p>

<p>From a letter in the possession of Lord Lansdowne, the owner of “The
Gladiator,” which, by the courtesy of his lordship, I am able to
transcribe, we learn that this picture was not sold until the year
1772. In Wright’s MS. book the price named is £40. and Dr. Bates is
entered as the purchaser. This price must be an error, or only a part
payment, as will be seen from the letter, which is from Wright to Dr.
Bates, and was sold with the picture. There is little doubt that this
was the picture mentioned in the letter, although it is not referred to
by name.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="r1">“Derby, 12th September, 1772.</p>

<p class="smcap">“Dear Sir,</p>

<p>“Last night I received a letter from our friend Burdett,
whereby I understood you consent to give me £130 for the
picture. I must let it go at that price, as I am under a
necessity of immediately raising £1,200 on a mortgage, and
have only £1,000 by me, it was on this account I offered it to
you at 125 guineas. I shall say no more on the subject, only
desire for my interest, you will never mention what you gave
for it, as it might much injure me in the future sale of my
pictures, and when I send you a receipt for the money I shall
acknowledge a greater sum.</p>

<p>“I wish it may be convenient for you to remit me the money
immediately, as Michaelmas is the time fixed for the payment
of the money, and though I have lent more money than I now
want, upon the person’s bare note, and without interest,
I know not a man that would lend me a hundred pounds
without high interest and good security. You see how I am
circumstanced, and have no doubt but you’ll immediately assist
me with the money if you can. I think myself much obliged to
you for offering me the assistance any of your pictures can
give me.</p>

<p>“I am, with compliments to Mrs. Bates, though not known,</p>

<p class="left1">“Dear sir,</p>

<p class="left2">“Your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="r1">“JO. WRIGHT.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon examining the following list of his pictures exhibited at the
Rooms of the Society of Artists, it will be noticed that for ten years,
from 1765 to 1775, only one landscape is mentioned; but on his return
from Italy, in 1776, he exhibited his first picture of Vesuvius, and
from this date he evidently paid much more attention to landscape, and
almost ceased to paint candle-light effects, which, up to that date,
had, with portraiture, almost entirely engrossed his pencil.</p>

<p>Whilst in Italy he made many landscape sketches from nature, which
supplied him on his return to England with the greater part of the
material for the landscapes he produced from 1775<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> to within a few
years of his death, although these were interspersed with scenes from
Scotland, Derbyshire, and the Lake District.</p>

<p>Wright was at an early period elected a member of the Society of
Artists, to whose exhibitions in the Spring Gardens he contributed
many years, as will be seen from the following lists extracted from
the catalogues. It is to be regretted that at this date it was not
the custom to mention in catalogues the names of the persons whose
portraits were exhibited, and in consequence of the lapse of time, it
is now often impossible to identify them.</p>

<p>From the foregoing list of Wright’s contributions to Exhibitions of the
Royal Academy, it will be noticed that he did not send any between the
years 1782 and 1788. This abstention was caused by his resentment at
the conduct of the Academy, in consequence of which he refused the full
diploma which the Royal Academy offered to him in 1784.</p>

<p>From the following extract from the <i>Athenæum</i> of January 31st, 1885,
it appears that Wright was not the only artist of distinction who at
that period had to complain of the treatment of the Council of the
Royal Academy.</p>

<p>“In the archives of the Royal Academy is a letter which has special
interest. It is a complaint addressed by Gainsborough to the Council of
the Academy, about the manner in which his most important contribution
to the gathering of 1784 had been treated, being placed in a position,
he says, unbecoming its character as a group of Royal portraits, and
unjust to himself as a R.A. In the end, with several other works
the artist left at the Hanging Committee’s discretion, the picture
was withdrawn, so that the Academy gathering of 1784 comprised no
Gainsborough.</p>

<p>“The artist abandoned the Academy altogether, and during the four
remaining years of his life, he sent no more pictures.”</p>

<p>The doors of the Academy being thus practically closed to Wright, he
determined on another plan for bringing his works under public notice.
In 1785 he opened an exhibition, composed of twenty-five of his own
pictures, at Mr. Robins’s Rooms, Covent Garden, London. This is an
early instance of those exhibitions devoted to the compositions of a
single artist which have of late become so frequent. In the catalogue
of it which we are enabled to reprint, it will be noticed that fifteen
out of the twenty-five works exhibited were not for sale.</p>

        <div>Where, as to life, the wondrous figures rise.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Wright so far forgave the injury he considered the Royal Academy had
inflicted upon him, as to contribute to their exhibitions in the years
1788, 1789, 1790, and 1794; though from the correspondence printed in
Chapter VI., it will be seen that his paintings were not treated with
much consideration.</p>

<p>One characteristic worthy of notice in Wright’s portraiture, is
the life-like and liquid look that pervades the eyes; he was also
particularly happy in his treatment of the hands of his sitters, which
are very different to the misshapen forms that often do duty for hands
in paintings by popular artists.</p>

<p>An exhibition, in which his pictures were an important feature, appears
to have been held in his native town some two years afterwards, for
the <i>Derby Mercury</i>, of October 3, 1787, contains the following
advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center p-left p2 xl gesperrt">EXHIBITION.</p>

<p class="center p-left p1h">From the numerous and genteel company who have visited this
<i>Exhibition</i>, the Inventor will continue the same</p>

<p class="center p-left p1h">FOR ONE WEEK LONGER,</p>

<p class="center p-left p1h">And to the effects already shown will add various others</p>

purpose Mr. Wright has politely sent the Inventor his

<p class="center p-left p1h">It is hoped none will miss the present and only opportunity of

<p class="center p-left p1h">Admittance from Ten in the morning till One, and from Four
till Eight in the evening, at Mr. Wood’s, Confectioner, in the
Corn Market, at One Shilling ea.</p></blockquote>

<p>While, however, Wright appears to have had a proper sense of his own
merits as a painter, and not to have lost sight of the advantages of
keeping them before the public, and though on certain occasions he
held out for his price, he was neither conceited nor ungenerous. Of
his liberality sufficient proof is afforded by his numerous gifts
of valuable pictures to individuals among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> his private friends, and
to persons to whom he thought himself under obligation. In various
instances, these gifts were manifestly disinterested; and that they
were often, and probably always, conferred in a very pleasing manner,
which declined rather than sought the expression of gratitude, the
following records will sufficiently vouch.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mr. Hayley to Mrs. Hayley.</p>

<p class="left3">... “As I love to make you a sharer in every pleasing
occurrence of my life, I cannot let a post depart without
dispatching to you an account of a circumstance which has
given me no little delight. Beridge last night committed a
box to my care, declaring it contained something for me, but
requesting that I would not open it till he arrived here
to-day. After spending an agreeable morning at Hampstead, I
met the dear Physician in Cavendish Square; and while I was
dressing, he displayed his skill as a carpenter in opening
the packing-case. When I came from my dressing-room to the
dining-room, he surprised me with an exquisite picture of
Virgil’s Tomb, by Wright, putting into my hand a letter from
that amiable artist, requesting my acceptance of this poetical
scene, and added, that the splendid frame which contained it
was the gift of Dr. Beridge.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The following is part of a letter written on the margin of a pencil and
wash sketch of St. Peter’s at Rome, with the Bridge and Tower of St.
Angelo, to someone in Derby, in the year 1774, when Wright was at Rome&mdash;</p>

<p>“The collour’d drawing I will do for you must be upon a larger scale,
and sent by a friend, as I don’t wish to do them as letters, but I
presume the enclos’d sort as sketches of observation, or possibly to
remove any doubt in regard to particular objects, as I take them as
faithfully as I can, and shall do the others also. In the meantime I
beg you will make no scruple in mentioning any particular objects that
you wish, as I have justly every reason to have the greatest esteem for
you, and having experienced your sincerity and friendship, I beg you
will mention no more about the prices.”</p>

<p>In the Exhibition of Wright’s works, held in the Art Gallery, at Derby,
in 1883, was the latest portrait<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of the artist. This picture was
also a gift, and was painted at Yoxall Lodge, the residence of his
intimate friend, the Rev. T. Gisborne, when Wright was there on a
visit. On the back of the picture, in Wright’s handwriting, is the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p-left">“JOSEPHUS WRIGHT,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>At Ogston Hall another inscription of the same class is to be seen, in
Wright’s handwriting, on the back of a portrait of John Holland, who
was a very intimate friend, viz.:</p>

<p>“John Holland, painted by his friend, Joseph Wright, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>,

        <div>What artist has a better made.’”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Again, on the back of a landscape, now in the possession of Godfrey
Wedgwood, Esq., is written the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The gift of Joseph Wright to his friend Jos. Wedgwood, Esq., the
patron and encourager of living artists, 1787.”</p>

<p>In the Appendix, amongst the list of pictures, will be found many more
instances of such gifts. Thus: “Given to my friend Tate.” “For Mr.
Hayley. Mem. not paid.” etc.</p>

<p>As a Water-colour painter of the English school, Wright must be ranked
as one of the earliest. Whilst he largely used chalk, pencil, and
oils in his sketches, he also used Water-colours in not a few of his
Italian sketches taken in 1774. He evidently little thought then, that
Water-colour painting would advance and take the high position as an
art that it occupies to-day, when he, as a pioneer, made those early
Water-colour sketches; for he, in his correspondence, remarks, “1795.
I am glad to hear my friend, Tate, succeeded so well in Water-colours.
I daresay when the application of them is well understood it is
pleasant work.” “1793. I am sorry I cannot fulfil my engagement with
Mr. Moreland, Mr. Gisborne does not think himself at liberty to divulge
Smith’s mode of washing with Water-colours.”</p>

<p>In 1795 he writes, “I am glad to hear my good friend (Tate) has laid
hold of his brushes again. Paper and camel hair pencils are better
adapted to the amusement of ladies than the pursuit of an artist.”</p>

<p>The Messrs. Redgrave, in their “Century of Painters,” say, “We have
heard of, but not seen, works in this medium by Wright, of Derby.” It
is gratifying to know that there are in existence some interesting
landscape sketches and portraits in Water-colours by Wright, that tend
to show that Wright could use the new medium with great effect and
brilliancy.</p>

<p>Before leaving England he wrote the following letter to his brother,
Richard Wright:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="r1">“1773.</p>

<p>“Dear Brother,</p>

<p class="left3">“By the waggon yesterday I sent you in a box four pillar
Candlesticks called Tooth &amp; Egg, to be cleaned as silver.
They <i>are</i> what they <i>seem</i> to be, w<sup>ch</sup> if I mistake not
your temper, will be more pleasing to you than a refined
outside, with a Base inside. They are such at least as best
suit my Taste &amp; pocket, &amp; I sincerely hope you’ll receive
them as a pledge of the Love I bear you. I shall be glad to
hear you have got ’em safe. Thursday last I got on board the
Jupiter all our Baggage, and a Case with the two pictures of
the Alchymist and Captive King, for so my Friends advised
me. The ship is sailed for Exeter, when she will arrive is
as uncertain as the Winds that blow her. However, I hope the
Cap<sup>t.</sup> will soon send us a summons to embark. The winter
approaches fast, and will, I fear, blast those Joys I promised
myself at a more agreeable time of the year; however, I
flatter myself <i>matrimony</i> has improved my Constitution, and I
am better able to bear the rude winds than heretofore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Last week my Sister Nancy and this family went on board the
‘Jupiter,’ afterwards we were conducted by the Cap<sup>t.</sup> to
his house, where we dined with the rest of the passengers; a
good thought this of the Cap<sup>t.</sup> that we might not when we
met on board wear the awkward faces of strangers. I shall be
very happy to hear again from you ere we leave English ground,
and if you write on Saturday night it will I think get here
in time. Tell M<sup>r.</sup> Greenwood the Drawings will be ready
whenever he sends for them. I rec’d the Ruffles safe. Make my
affectionate Comp<sup>ts.</sup> to M<sup>rs.</sup> Fox &amp; M<sup>rs.</sup> Shelton; I
dreamt she was got so well as to visit her Friends, would she
was really so.</p>

<p>He evidently proved a bad sailor, for in his first letter home, written
from Nice, he says, “The continual agitation of the ship soon rendered
us very sick, and we not only lost sight of land, but of everything
save our cabin, and the vessel into which we discharged the contents of
our sickly stomachs.” He spent many months in Rome, studying especially
the works of Michael Angelo, in the Capella Sestina of the Vatican. He
here made faithful drawings, upon a larger scale than had generally
been attempted, as he considered those subjects but ill-adapted for
pocket-book sketches. “These Treasures of Art<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> have hitherto
remained, in a great degree, lost to the world, having scarcely been
seen except by Mr. Wright’s particular friends, to whom he showed
them, when his imagination was warmed with a description of the divine
originals.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In Hayley’s Life of Romney we read, “In 1773, Romney
went to Italy, where he acquainted himself with all the artists of
his country, for I recollect his having repeatedly lamented that our
amiable friend, Wright, the painter of Derby, had laid the foundation
of those cruel nervous sufferings which afflicted his later years, by
excess of application during his residence in Rome.”</p>

<p>His letters from Italy are very interesting, especially for his
opinions on various celebrated Works of Art. A few extracts must
suffice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="left3">“ ... And on Sunday, 5th Dec. (1773), came into port at Nice amidst
thousands of spectators of all ranks, who were placed on steps, their
heads rising one above another had a very pleasing effect, like the
crowded galleries of a theatre. It was on the ‘Jupiter’s’ account this
large assembly were gathered together, she being the largest vessel
that has sailed into this port, and I fancy I may add the best, she
weathered without any material injury many storms.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="r1">Rome, Feb<sup>y</sup> 4th, 1774.</p>

<p>“As I know my Dear Brother &amp; Sister will be better pleased to
have a speedy account of our safe arrival here, from an hasty
&amp; irregular Letter, than from a more accurate one with delay,
I embrace the first minute to tell you we got here last night
in tolerable Sp<sup>ts</sup> considering the tedious Journey we had
from Leghorn, w<sup>ch</sup> is not 200 miles. We were advised as the
best mode of travelling for those who speak not the language
of the Country to engage with a man to take us to Rome for so
much money &amp; to accommodate us with every necessary on the
Road. The Carriages have only two wheels, like our one horse
chairs, drawn by the same pair of horses all the way, w<sup>ch</sup>
travel about as fast as our Stage waggons; we were obliged
to rise by three in the morning to go betwixt 20 &amp; 30 miles
a day, to arrive at night at a poor house, with large cold
rooms, &amp; bad accommodation, very unpleasing to the English
traveller. By the advice of M<sup>r.</sup> Cesar, M<sup>r.</sup> Heathcote’s
friend at Pisa, I provided myself with a large Cloak, such
as the Italians use; w<sup>ch</sup> kept me tolerably comfortable by
day &amp; night, in w<sup>ch</sup> I lay, for I durst not undress, the
Beds being seldom lain in. Cap<sup>t.</sup> Difting’s delay threw us
into the Winter which has been attended with much cost &amp; many

<blockquote>

<p class="r1">“Rome, Feb. 12, 1774.</p>

<p class="smcap">“My Dear Brother,</p>

<p class="left3">“I fully intended sending this Letter according to the first
date, but was prevented by the visits of the English; and many
other occurrences has since happened to prolong my silence
beyond my wish, as I know you will be anxious to have a second
Letter; tho’ I wrote to M<sup>r.</sup> Coltman from Genoa, who wou’d,
I hope, inform you I was well. I am (<i>entre nous</i>) surprized
he shou’d think of quitting the Close till he has it brought
into as good condition as he found it. If he leaves it so
he must have gained much by it. If M<sup>r.</sup> Brentnall has it,
who, according to your account, I have no objection to, care
should be taken that he does nothing to the disadvantage of
my Close to benefit his own. I am sorry poor Dick has been so
unfortunate at his first setting out, it was enough to give
him an insurmountable prejudice, for the sea is terrible in
stormy weather. I am sorry he is still likely to be expensive
to us, only because I can’t now so well afford it as formerly.
This Tour has &amp; will cost me much more than I expected. My
wife has been but indifferent, the storms by sea, and the
violent shaking by land (for some parts of the road is very
stony) have been too much for her. I called in a Doctor who
said it was necessary she should loose blood, accordingly the
next morning was appointed for the operation. The D<sup>r.</sup> &amp;
his Surgeon came, never did I see such parade, they talked of
Galen &amp; Hypocrates &amp; abundance of stuff, to conceal, I fear,
their Ignorance. However, M<sup>rs.</sup> Wright is better, they are
against purging and have ordered her to drink a small liquor
which they call Sherbett, to thin her blood. I have not wrote
to M<sup>r.</sup> Shackleford, I did not think it necessary, &amp; his
behaviour to me required it not I am sure, for whatever he
may say of generosity &amp; Gratitude, I never saw the least
shadow of it. I was very fortunate in getting both yours &amp;
Nancy’s Letters; my wife has not heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> from her friends,
nor has Hurleston, nor Downman<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> who came with us received
any Letters. I shall be glad to hear from you as soon as
your business will permit. The air here is not so cold as in
England, but it is very thin &amp; searching. Nancy tells me she
has heard the Empress of Russia<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> has taken ye picture of
the Iron Forge, but does not like the Hermit. I hope by this
time you have heard from Burdett &amp; to some purpose. Make my
affectionate Comp<sup>ts.</sup> to Coltmans, Hopes, Denby, &amp;c., &amp;c.,

Sister is no better. Give my love to her. Make my Comp<sup>ts.</sup>

Cap<sup>t.</sup> Heathcote&mdash;he’s well. When I write again I hope we
shall be settled, when you shall hear more particularly from
me. It is now Carnival time at Rome, the Romans are all mad.
M<sup>r.</sup> Coke, our member’s son, has done me the honor of a
visit. M<sup>rs.</sup> Flint’s death alarmed me much, tho’ I thought
before I left Derby she declined fast. M<sup>rs.</sup> Clayton’s
indisposition surprised me. What great alterations does a
little time make in a small circle of acquaintance. Pray how
does M<sup>rs.</sup> Shelton, our good friend M<sup>rs.</sup> Fox, I hope
for their mutual happiness they both are well. Pray has Miss
Fowler received the colours she gave me a commission for, my

you to tell him I shall be glad if he would look after the

so much employment for my eyes (w<sup>ch</sup> by the by are not so
good as they have been) in the art I am in search of that I

<p class="smcap">“Dear Sister,</p>

<p class="left3">“After waiting many a post-day with great impatience and
anxiety, I at last rec<sup>d</sup> a letter from my dear brother;
from my sister and Coltman’s letters, I had reason to have
expected one much sooner, w<sup>ch</sup> made the delay intolerable,
and filled me with many a doubt and many a fear, lest he
should have relapsed into his grievous illness. I have felt
much on y<sup>e</sup> occasion, and the account he has given me of it
(tho’ the danger I hope to God is over), is even now very
alarming, from the reflection of what might have happened.
You, my dear sister, being witness to the malady, must have
suffered much: I sincerely wish him a speedy and perfect
re-establishment of his health. Ill health is one of the
greatest evils that can befall man in my opinion, the truth
of w<sup>ch</sup> both you and myself have had woeful experience, and
I am sorry to hear you still labour under the affliction.
Mine, thank God, is much better. This climate is certainly
very salutary, and would, I think, perfectly restore me, was
not my attention and application continually engaged with the
amazing and stupendous remains of antiquity; and so numerous
are they, that one can scarce move a foot but the relics of
some stupendous works present themselves. When I consider the
immense size of the whole, and the beauty of the parts, I
cannot help reflecting how trifling and insignificant are the
present operations of mankind; we are no better than infants,
and ought to wear daiding strings. I have no time to enter
into a particular detail of the fine things this country
abounds with; let it suffice to tell you at present, that the
artist finds here whatever may facilitate and improve his
studies. The Antique remains of Art, as I said before, are
wonderful. The natural scenes are beautiful and uncommon, with
an atmosphere so pure and clear, that objects twenty miles
distant seem not half the way.</p>

<p>“The women are in general handsome, they walk admirably, and
have a gentility and ease about them peculiar to themselves.
’Tis not in the costliness of their habits that they outdo
the English, but in the form and manner of wearing them. Vast
quantity of fine hair, elegantly disposed of, with sometimes a
very small cap, with jewels, &amp;c., are the ornaments of their
head; and when they go out, instead of putting on a hat,
they wear black gauze, w<sup>ch</sup> is gathered behind, and hangs
from the upper and back part of the head over the face: of a
beautiful woman or rather face, one sees so much as to make
one wish to see more; of a plain one, it partly conceals the
defects. They all wear long trains to their gowns, however
ordinary the stuff, w<sup>ch</sup> has a grand effect. The common
people dress in the same manner, tho’ with worse materials,
and from the mutual intercourse one with another&mdash;for in
the summer months they sit in the streets and pursue their
occupations&mdash;they have an easiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> of deportment that is
amazing; their dress, too, which is perfectly easy and
picturesque, contributes much to it.</p>

partly to satisfy my curiosity for seeing one of the most
wonderful parts of the world, and partly to improve my health
impaired by the intense heats and too close application to
study. There has not been known at Rome so hot a summer as
the last these many years past. In the month of August the
thermometer in the sun was 120 degrees, in y<sup>e</sup> shade 96.
At Florence the heat was so great as to affect many with a
kind of delirium, and others it proved fatal to. I never
before experienced such intolerable heat, so great was the
perspiration occasioned by it, notwithstanding we have one of
the most airy situations here, as made it necessary to sit
still and constantly wipe off the sweat as it distilled, this
relaxed the mind and body so much as to render them unfit for
study and application. I am surprised Sir W<sup>m.</sup> Meredith is
not punctual in his payment, if he has not paid when you write
to me again, tell me so, and I will write to him about it. I
am glad my tenants like their closes, I hope their pains and

<p class="smcap">“Dear Sister,</p>

<p class="left3">“I thought I should have dated this letter from Florence, but
I am like all other artists that come here, who much outstay
their intended time, and at last leave the noble and renowned
city (Rome) with reluctance. Notwithstanding, I have been very
industrious, more so perhaps than has been consistent with my
health, yet shall I leave undone many things that I covet much
to have. I have staid a month longer than I intended, to have
an answer from Mr. Baxter, the Russian Consul, concerning the
picture I have painted of Mount Vesuvius in a great eruption,
’tis the grandest effect I ever painted. If the Empress is to
have it, it must be shipped from Leghorn to St. Petersburg,
and I must wait here to see it off. I wish she may take it, a
100 guineas will not be unacceptable, for it is not so cheap
living abroad as generally represented; we pay for a floor
consisting of 6 rooms at the rate of £40 a year. The tour of
Italy is now become so fashionable, and the English cavaliers
so profuse with their money, that the artists suffer for their
prodigality.</p>

<p>“I should have finished this letter according to the date, but
have again had inflamed eyes, and have been much indisposed
with sore throats and colds. The weather this spring has been
very awkward, always varying from hot to cold&mdash;sometimes
harsh, dry winds, at other times violent rains; in short,
the air of Rome is by no means good; and when I consider my
health only, &amp; the many indispositions I have had here, I am
not sorry we are to leave on Sunday, 10th June. We go from
hence to Florence, where I suppose we shall stay a month or
six weeks, &amp; then to Parma, where the most famous picture of
Corregio is. If the picture answers to its character, I shall
make a copy of it, it will improve me; and if I choose to sell
it, it will be advantageous. When I have finished at Parma,
we shall go to Venice to study Titian’s colouring. These
engagements will detain me in Italy the hot weather, and to
return to England in the cold will not be advisable for me. If
I can get over the Alps before the snow falls, and pass the
winter advantageously at Bordeaux, in the south of France, it
will, I believe, be the best scheme for my health. It has been
said, if I chose to paint portraits at Bordeaux I might be
employed all the winter.</p>

<p>“Give my comp<sup>ts.</sup> to my good friend Coltman (to whom I wrote
some 7 or 8 weeks ago), and tell him of my intention. But I
should not choose to go there on an uncertainty, as it is not
a place of art. Perhaps he will write to some of his friends
there to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> what encouragement I might meet with there for

<p class="r1">“Parma, July 24th, 1775.</p>

<p class="smcap">“Dear Sir,</p>

<p class="left3">“In conformity to your request I am sat down to give you my
opinion of the famous picture of Correggio, of which how shall
I dare speak, but in the current terms of exalted praise. You
know the world’s opinion of it, &amp; if mine does not exactly
coincide with it, it is not from any affectation of being
singular in my opinion, but the result of such judgment as
I have, divested of every thing that has been said, for or
against it.</p>

<p>“As to the composition &amp; light &amp; shadow, you are as well
acquainted as myself from y<sup>e</sup> copies you have seen. The
picture is beautifully coloured, has surprising brilliancy,
without whiteness, and is very harmonious. The parts are
very round and forcibly painted, but is laboured as to beget
tameness&mdash;I had almost said woodenness in many parts. The
faces are wonderfully soft, but they want those beautiful
turns &amp; spirited touches we see in nature, &amp; which keeps
high-finished pictures from looking heavy. The flesh is finely
coloured, is very clear, and has a sanguine appearance that
is very pleasing, but withal not so true as Titian’s Venus.
The draperies are neither very finely set nor painted, nor had
Correggio the finest eye for shapes; yet after all the whole
together is wonderfully sweet, &amp; one cannot help being charmed
with the effect. Romney only painted the Magdalen’s head, the
picture answered not his expectations; and Mr. Parry left his
quite unfinished, as the picture did not appear so fine to him
a second time as it did the first. Mr. Copley has been hard at
it five weeks, &amp; says he will spend twice that time more over
it, but he will get it like the original. It is with infinite
labour he produces what he does, but that is <i>entre nous</i>. I
have left my outline, with two English three-quarter cloths,
which you seemed to admire, with the Custodio of the academy,
directed for you.</p>

<p>“I am quite tired of seeing pictures, the general run of them
are so indifferent&mdash;even Venice answered not my expectation.
Titian’s works are so changed and damaged, &amp; when Mr. Romney
said he was not to be seen out of Venice, he meant in grand
composition &amp; expression.</p>

<p>“In the Sacristy of the Salute are three ceilings, the one
of David &amp; Goliath, Abraham offering his son, &amp; the third I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>don’t know y<sup>e</sup> subject; these are finely painted &amp; designed
in a Mic’ Angelo like style. Romney did not copy the St.
John; a disaster happened which you will hear of at Venice, &amp;
which I have not now time to relate; he painted a half-length
of Montague and two or three heads, which he will finish in
England. Mr. Jenkins was so obliging to ship my cases for me.
I had desired poor Mr. Stevens to pay Mr. Jenkins any charge
there might be upon them; I wish you would be kind enough to
settle it for me, I will repay you when I have the pleasure
to see you in England. If you will indulge me with a line

<p>“Naples.&mdash;St. Martino Del Monte. In a Chapel belonging to the Castle of
St. Elmo is the famous picture of Spanioletto of a Dead Christ; this
picture is esteemed his best. Mr. Forrester bought one of the same
in Rome, which is now in the possession of&mdash;&mdash;, and thought equally
good. ’Tis well painted and coloured, has great expression and force.
In the Church in compartments over the arches are single figures,
painted also by Spanioletto, some of them very fine, indeed. I admire
his manner, ’tis forcible and natural. This Church of St. Martino Del
Monte belongs to the order of Carthusians, which is the richest of
all orders, indeed, the riches of this Church prove it. Such elegant
things of gold and silver, set with all kinds of precious stones,
I never before beheld. In the King’s palace on Capo Del Monte is a
very large collection of Pictures, Medals, Cameos, and Intaglios. The
famous picture of Titian of Danaë in the shower of gold, is wonderfully
painted, but time and varnishes have robbed it of its beautiful
colouring, it is now too yellow and spotty. The action is fine and well
adapted to the subject, it is better drawn than any I have seen of him.</p>

<p>“In the palace on Capo Del Monte is perhaps the largest piece of
Rock Crystal in the world, it is of an irregular shape, one way it
is upwards of a yard in diameter, the other about a yard, ’tis very
transparent. Here are a great number of Cameos, both single heads and
compositions wonderfully fine. Here also is the finest and largest
Cameo I ever saw, it is an oval figure, and upwards of 6 inches the
longest way. An Holy family by Raphael, small figures very highly
finished, the picture very capital. Lord Scarsdale has a copy of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
That sweet little Magdalen lying along on the ground, by Corregio, is
here also, as are many others by the same Master.</p>

<p>“In the King of Naples’ palace is a very capital picture of a Holy
family, by Raphael, it is finely composed, the Virgin is lovely, and
the expression of Jesus and St. John wonderful. It is in his best
manner and in good preservation, the Cartoon of it is at the King’s
palace on Capo Monte, the size of the picture. At the same place is a
very fine portrait of a Pope, by Titian, he is sitting in a chair. It
is charmingly painted, with a full pencil, and as far as I can judge
the effect is produced without glazing.</p>

<p>“At the palace are two fine oval pictures of Sal. Rosa, the subjects,
Banditti, very highly finished, and painted with great force and
spirit. A picture of Boys, very good, by Poussin.</p>

<p>“The City of Pompeio, 15 miles from Naples, which was overwhelmed by
the eruption of Vesuvius about fifteen hundred years ago (at which
Pliny, the elder, lost his life), and which was discovered 15 years
ago, seems to me to have been small, at least the houses, rooms, and
the street which remain indicate. They have, by the king’s order, dug
a good deal of the city, but much remains inveloped in a loose kind of
Lava. Parts of buildings intire, with the ornamental paintings on the
walls perfect, in style not much unlike some Chinese painting I have
seen, together with the Sculls &amp; bones of those that perished there,
make a very interesting scene. There is to be seen in one of the rooms
in which is fixed a stone vessel for washing in, an intire skeleton of
a woman who perished at her work. Whatever is found here, curious or
valuable, is deposited in the King’s Museum.</p>

<p>“Herculaneum is at the foot of Vesuvius on which Portici now stands,
is 6 miles from Naples, was destroyed probably by the same eruption as
Pompeio, the Lava which overwhelmned it is much more hard and compact
than that at Pompeio, owing perhaps to its vicinity to the Mountain.
The theatre is the only part which remains open, and that is partially
so, that one has but little idea of the construction of the whole.
They have dug much at Herculaneum and found many paintings &amp; other
antiquities which are at the Museum. As Portici stands upon Herculaneum
they dug but little at a time, &amp; when they got out the valuables filled
up the parts again, that the City of Portici might not be endangered.</p>

<p>“The Museum is the most interesting place I have seen, as it is filled
with the ornamental and useful utensils of Herculaneum and Pompeio.
Glad I am to find from the observations I have made in these places,
that the present age is not so degenerated, either in size or morals
as some imagine. The sculls of the old Romans were the size of the
present, and from the Chirurgical instruments which are in the Museum,
they were liable to the same disorders, indeed there is no doubt but
Nature was always the same &amp; will be so ad infinitum. But to return
to the contents of the Museum. There are many Bronze heads, one of
Seneca, very capital, the rest much inferior. The figures not of the
first-class. There is a Satyr lying on a skin of wine, snapping his
thumb &amp; finger, the expression very good; also two wrestlers in very
fine actions. A sitting figure of a Mercury, sweet attitude. Sculpture
good....</p>

<p>“Left Rome the 10th of June, 1775, came to Florence on the 19th, by
the way of Narni,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> Terni, Perugio, &amp;c., 180 miles; part of it a most
delightful and picturesque country, of which Claudio has availed
himself much. Florence is a pleasant City, the Arno with its Bridges
add greatly to its beauty. The one consisting of 3 arches only, is very
beautiful. There are a few fine things in Art. The Venus, the Boxers,
the little Apollo, the Dancing Faun &amp; the Grinder. Titian’s Venus,
Florence, did not answer my expectation; when one has seen Rome, other
places suffer by the comparison. Left Florence 4th July, passed over
the Appenines, a very wild country, the surface of which is the most
broken and irregular I ever saw. Came to Bologna, which is 66 miles,
on the 6th. Bologna is a large &amp; well-built City. Its piazzas are very
spacious &amp; beautiful, and not less convenient at all times of the year.
In the winter it defends you from wet, in summer from heat, which is
very great here. At St Agnatis is a picture, by Domenichino, of the
<i>murder</i> of that Saint, not good. The Expression weak, the lights of
bad shades &amp; not well combined. At the Sampiere Palace is a picture
of Guido of St. Peter &amp; St. Paul in his first manner, very forcibly
painted. St. Cæcilia, by Raphael, in St. Iovani in Monte, is much
damaged and not so fine as I expected to have found it, the figure
of St. Paul very fine. A large picture of Ludivico Caracci &amp; one of
the woman taken in adultery, some parts of it very good. The birth
of St. John, by ditto, very indifferent. At the Carthusian Convent,
which is a very elegant one, is the famous picture of Lud. Car. of
St. John the Baptist, the character &amp; expression of St. John’s head
seems to have been very fine, the other parts of the picture not very
good, the whole is much damaged. At the same Convent is a good picture
of Guercino. Left Bologna on the 9th and embarked for Venice, had a
very fatiguing passage thro’ the Canals, arrived at Venice the 12th,
was highly entertained with its first appearance, a City standing in
the sea. The chief works in painting are by Titian, Paul Veronese and
Tintoret. The large picture by Paul Ver. of the marriage in Canaan has
an ill effect altogether, it is a confused multitude. The personages
are chiefly portraits, and he has introduced Titian and other Artists
his friends as musicians in the centre of the picture; there are in it
some heads well painted. In St. Maria Maggiore is the famous picture
of St. John in the Wilderness, by Titian, this picture, like most of
Titian’s, is grown very brown &amp; dark, it seems to have been finely
painted in a broad manner; the drawing is good, as is the action, &amp; the
head has a good character. The picture by Do. of the martyrdom of St.
Peter, in St. Giovanni e paolo is much damaged, has been a very fine
picture, the actions &amp; expressions very natural &amp; spirited. Salute,
3 compartments in the ceiling, by Titian, of David &amp; Goliah, Abraham
offering his Son Isaac, and another which I don’t know the subject;
all these are finely painted and designed in a Mic. Angelo like style.
Church of the Ferari, two Altar pieces by Titian, the one on wood, of
the assumption of the Virgin, finely painted, but the colouring is
become quite brown, ’tis composed in a sublime manner. St. Marciliano,
in the Sacristy Tobia &amp; the Angel by Titian, has been a fine picture,
but is much damaged, the Angel fine character. School of St. Roch, on
the Stairs is a picture of the Annunciation, by Titian; sweet idea of
the Virgin. Jesuits Church, St. Laurence’s martyrdom, by Titian, the
figure of the Saint is very grand, the picture is become very dark, and
I believe never had the effect of fire. Saw in Venice many pictures of
Paul Veronese &amp; Tintoret. Left Venice the 19th, embarked for Padua, had
a very agreeable passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> by water, the country is well cultivated and
populous, along the sides of the Canals and river are a great number
of handsome houses, which for miles have the effect of one town. We
arrived at Padua, which is 27 miles from Venice, about 7 o’clock the
same evening. In the sacristy of the Duomo at Padua is a very fine
Madonna &amp; Child, by Titian, sweetly painted, &amp; in good preservation.
The head of the Virgin is lovely, &amp; the child is beautifully coloured &amp;
painted with more than usual care. Saw several Buildings by Palladio,
in very good taste. In the antique Gothic Church, anciently called
Maria Maggiore, now St. Antonio, here lies the body of the great Saint
in a very fine Altar, ’tis a fine Church with three or four Domes. The
great Saloon is a hundred &amp; ten paces long, &amp; eighty wide, the roof
is of wood of an Eliptical form. There are great numbers of Giotto’s
pictures here. The Room has a noble effect. Left Padua the 20th, at
Mezzo Giorno set off for Vicenza, arrived there at night, which is
eighteen miles, the next morning set off for Verona, which is 30 miles,
where we arrived at night. At Verona is an Amphitheatre, not comparable
to that of Rome, but more perfect, having the seats of such part of
the building as remains entire. In the center of it is erected a
wooden Theatre where they act by daylight. In the Church of St. George
is a picture of the martyrdom of that St., by Paulo Veronese, ’tis
in good condition, but slightly painted, &amp; in other respects nothing
extraordinary. The next morning left Verona &amp; arrived at Mantua at
night, which is 25 miles, there’s an Academy for Arts &amp; Sciences lately
built, elegant &amp; upon a good plan. Left Mantua on Sunday, 23rd, got
to Parma on Monday morning. Here is the famous picture of Correggio.
In St. Sepulchre is a Holy family, by Correggio, but so indifferent I
could scarce believe it his. The figure of Joseph is as poorly drawn
and the drapery as ill set as anything I ever saw, in short there’s
nothing good in the picture, nor do I like Correggio in his great
works; his figures are but ill drawn, the heads appear large and want
character. Left Parma on Thursday morning, got to Piacentia that night,
which is 36 miles, it was here that Hannibal, after having passed the
Alps for the first time engaged the Romans. Left Piacentia the next
morning. Got that night to Avougara, which is 32 miles. The next, 29th
July, dined at Allessandria. On the 30th at noon got to Turin. ’Tis
curious to be crying out with heat at the foot of the Alps, whose tops
are covered with snow. In the King’s palace at Turino is a very large
Collection of pictures, many of which are very fine. A man in armour
on horseback, as large as life, by Vandicke, very fine. The armour
is of dark rich colour, full of beautiful reflections, &amp; the lights
most spiritedly touched. By Ditto is a smallish picture of a Madona
&amp; Child, the heads very sweet, but the Body &amp; legs of the Child, not
fine. A fine Head by Rembrant. Here are a great number of Gerard Dow,
very fine, among which is a composition of four or five figures of the
Doctor examining his patients. This picture is so wonderfully clear &amp;
brilliantly coloured, so astonishingly finished, that it seems to me
to be perfection in that style of painting. Several charming pictures
of Da. Teniers of Boors, and one piece of witchcraft or Incantation,
all delightfully painted with such sober clearness and touched with
such truth and Spirit, that one’s pleased &amp; surprized. I forgot to
mention Van Dick’s picture of King Charles’ 3 children, which is a
capital one, the youngest has great relief without shadow, and such a
sweet childish expression as I never before saw. The composition is
simple, unaffected, &amp; fine, so is the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> &amp; shadow, but the keeping
is strong. The whole is very harmonious and has great effect. There
is a reddish brown dog wonderfully painted, position fine, &amp; accords
charmingly with the fine red drapery of the Boy by whom he stands.
This drapery is finely painted the light lies on the body &amp; hips, &amp;
graduates very sensibly downwards. The white sattin of the middle girl
is much kept down, the little girl is in blue sattin, with gauze linen;
several Landscapes by Botts &amp; Berghem, very fine. A small historical
picture, by Rembrant, an old head in it, of a most divine Character.
Comondear Genevi Genevos at Turin, has a very good Collection of
pictures, amongst which was a very fine half-length of a St., by Guido,
in his first manner, it is well finished, at the same time spiritedly
painted. The head has a fine character. Left Turin, which is one of
the most uniform &amp; best built Cities I have ever been in, on the first
of August. Crossed the Alps in our way to Lyons, this country is truly
sublime. At the foot of Mount Sennis we left our Carriages and took
Mules to go over the mountain. Mrs. Wright with little Pop were carried
in a chair by six men. We were three hours &amp; half or 4 ascending the
mountain, about two thirds of the way is pretty large plain, on which
is a Lake about two miles over, here the sight was tremendous, the
mountains still rising to an incredible height, hiding their lofty
heads in the Clouds, which the winds now &amp; then dissipating shewed
partially their hoary towering craggy tops, here it was very cold, and
so it was all through Savoy. This Country is mountainous &amp; some parts
picturesque. From thence to Lyons is a flat country.”</p>

<p>There is no further account of Wright’s proceedings after crossing the
Alps on the 1st of August, 1775. Wright, his wife, and child, arrived
at his brother Richard’s, at Derby, on September 26th, 1775.</p>

<p>The little Anna Romana<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> was, with her cousin<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> (who was a month
old on that day), christened at St. Michael’s Church, each brother
being godfather to the other’s child, and their two sisters being
godmothers to both. Little “Pop” was a lively, active child, and did
not approve of the proceedings, as she slapped the clergyman in the
face.</p>

<p>My own opinion as to the effect of Wright’s visit to Italy is that it
increased his knowledge, widened his views of art, and enlarged his
style; but this is a very different one from that expressed by the
authors of “A Century of Painters.” As this book has a position of
considerable authority, I think it right to state my total disagreement
with what appears to me the unjust opinion contained in the following
extract from Messrs. Redgrave’s work:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In 1773 he married, and took that opportunity to visit Italy, where
he remained two years, studying, it is said, the works of the great
masters, especially those of Michael Angelo, from which he made many
copies on a large scale. But however much the works in the Sistine
Chapel may have impressed him at the time, they had little influence on
his subsequent practice.”</p>

<p>The sketches here alluded to are thirty-six in number, bound in vellum,
with “Joseph Wright, Rome, 1774,” written on the side by himself.
The book measures 20 × 13 inches;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> the drawings are outlined by the
pen, and broad washes of Indian ink effect the light and shade of the
drapery. They are done in a bold and masterly manner, and convey a very
good impression of the grandeur of the originals. There is a family
tradition that Wright injured his health by over-work when in Rome,
and that, for greater ease when working these drawings, he lay upon
his back on the cold floor of the Sistine Chapel, and contracted an
affection of the liver, which, as years went on, caused him much pain,
and prevented him from following his profession for months at a time.
On comparing these sketches with various of his pictures, the influence
of Michael Angelo upon Wright, especially in design, is evident; and
in other respects&mdash;such as his choice of subjects, and method of
handling&mdash;his art changed very much after his return from Italy.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Soon after Wright’s return from Italy, an Irish Bishop<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> bespoke a
large picture of Vesuvius, and on passing through Derby called at his
painting-rooms to look at it. The mountain and burning lava were nearly
finished, but the foreground being only laid in, there wanted the bold
dark parts to give effect to the brilliant lights. On seeing it, the
Bishop literally addressed him in the language used by Hayley in the
following lines, and in consequence Wright would not allow him to have
the picture, nor would he ever sell it. It hung in his dining-room
during his life-time, and is still in the possession of a member of his
family. In the MS. list of Wright’s paintings it is entered “Vesuvius
for Bp. Derry, £105,” but the indignant artist has dashed his pen
through the entry.</p>

        <div>But his spirit more mean than his gusto was nice,</div>
        <div>Tried a singular trick for reducing the price.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></div>
        <div>And his bargain to make either cheaper or void,</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Hayley intended these lines to be inserted in the newspapers, and sent
them to Wright for his approbation, who thought them so very severe
that he objected to their being published, and only showed them to
a few of his most intimate friends. The original copy is now in the
possession of the writer.</p>

<p>Gainsborough having left Bath in 1774, it was thought by Wright that
there would be a good opening for a portrait painter in that city, and
accordingly in December of that year he left Derby with his family. At
Bath,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> however, he met with but little patronage, as we learn from
the following extracts from letters:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="r1">“Bath, Jan. 15, 1776.</p>

<p>“Since I wrote the within, Lady Ferrers has brought the
Dutchess of Cumberland to see my pictures, w<sup>ch</sup> her Highness
much approves of. Thro’ Lady Ferrers’ recommendation her
Highness will sit to me for a full-length; a good beginning
this, tho’ a late one, and I hope will prove successful. I am
glad the conclusion of my letter is better than the beginning.</p>

<p class="r1">“JO. WRIGHT.”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="r15" />

<blockquote>

<p class="r1">“Bath, 9th February, 1776.</p>

<p>“I have now past one season, the biggest of the two, without
any advantage. The Duchess of Cumberland is the only sitter I
have had, and her order for a full-length dwindled to a head
only, which has cost me so much anxiety, that I had rather
have been without it; the great people are so fantastical and
whining, they create a world of trouble, tho’ I have but the
same fate as S<sup>r</sup> Jos. Reynolds, who has painted two pictures
of her Highness, and neither please. I am confident I have
some enemies in this place, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> propagate a report that
I paint fire-pieces admirably, but they never heard of my
painting portraits; such a report as this was mentioned to her
Royal Highness, after she had given me the commission for a
full-length, as I was told by one of her domestics.</p>

<p>“This is a scheme of some artists here (who, to our shame be
it said, seldom behave liberally to one another) to work me
out, and certainly it proves at present very injurious to me,
and I know not whether it will be worth my while (considering
how little business is done here, and has been done these
four or five years past) to stay to confute ’em. I have heard
from London, and by several gentlemen here, that the want
of business was the reason of Gainsborough’s leaving Bath.
Wou’d I had but known this sooner, for I much repent coming
here. The want of encouragement of the Arts, I fear, is not
only felt here but in Town also, and artists are become so
numerous that the share which falls to each is small. I wish I
had tried London first, and if it had not suited me, I would
then have retired to my native place, where, tho’ upon smaller
gains, I could have lived free from the strife and envy of
illiberal and mean-spirited artists. What I have seen since
I have been here has so wounded my feelings, so disturbed my
peace, as to injure my health, but I will endeavour to shake
it off.</p>

here, and better success with regard to the sale of them,
or I shall be run aground with this year’s expenses. I have
only painted 4 heads yet; the prejudice still runs high
against me. I am now painting a half-length of Dr. Wilson &amp;
his adopted daughter, Miss Macauley; this is for reputation
only, but you must not say so. The Doctor is a very popular
man, and is fighting in my cause stoutly, for he thinks me
ill-treated; he wishes he had known of my being in Bath five
or six months ago, he could have been of use to me before now,
and I wonder my friend Coltman (if he knew) did not mention
him to me; indeed, if I stay I shall have need of all the
friends I can make. I know not what to think of it, sometimes
revenge spirits me up to stay and endeavour to triumph over
my enemies; at other times more peaceful reflections take
place, &amp; I am for retiring to pursue my old walk of painting.

these rascally watermen, I plainly perceive they do not intend
making me restitution. I think if M<sup>r.</sup> Fallows would write
them a letter telling them that I should not trouble myself
any farther about the matter, but had desired him to inform
’em of the damage done me, w<sup>ch</sup> if they did not immediately
redress, to prosecute them, and advertize the affair in such
papers as may most affect them. The threatening them with a
prosecution, tho’ I don’t intend to throw away more money,
may be of use, but advertize them I certainly will. Give my
compliments to M<sup>r.</sup> Fallows and tell him, as I spent a day
over his picture, he will, I doubt not, do me this favour. The
carrier that brought my things from Bristol is esteemed an
honest man, he was present when the goods were weighed, that
their weight was 3 cwt., what they were at other places he has
no account. I am confident the theft had been committed some
time ere the things were delivered, from this circumstance: I
had occasion to pack in the hamper a piece of armour, w<sup>ch</sup>
I had some trouble with on account of the fulness of the
hamper, and could manage it no way but by putting it with the
concave side upwards down by the side of the hamper. This I
well remember, and M<sup>r.</sup> Haden will too. When I unpacked the
hamper the armour was in the middle of it, with the concave
side upwards, and the hay where it lay fresh and green, an
appearance you must have observed when anything has lain
long and undisturbed upon hay. From hence, I doubt not, the
mischief was done in the beginning of the voyage. But it
matters not, I shall look to those people to whom the goods
were first committed, let them seek further, pray don’t trifle
with them, that the affair may be made public while recent.
The account of the things taken, w<sup>ch</sup> upon proving the

as to endanger his life, it used in the thick winter weather
to be troublesome; perhaps the fall he got last year, of
w<sup>ch</sup> he complained at your house, hastened his end. Peace to
his soul. Since M<sup>r.</sup> Ward is dead, we are happy Miss Ward
did not regard our importuning her to stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> here, pray make
our compliments to her and all friends. My little boy and girl
are well. Jo is about his teeth and cross at times. We expect
to see his fourth every day. He has drove about his creed,
sometimes furiously, &amp; can walk 4 or 5 yards with a slack
dade. He grows very strong &amp; handsome. His nurse, to whom give
our service, would be proud to see him. Pop is an engaging
little girl, everybody that knows her loves her.... I have a
sitter, the first this year, but, thank heavens, I have other
employment w<sup>ch</sup> I will tell you of in my next.</p>

<p>There is no date or address to the following playful letter from Wright
to his sister Nancy, but judging from its contents, it was written from
Bath about 1775&ndash;6, as the second picture of the “Smith’s Shop” was
exhibited in the former year:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘What can this lazy, idle, good-for-nothing brother of mine be about?’
‘Why, writing to you, if you’ll only be civil, and not abuse me at this
rate. I am not idle, I assure you, nor lazy, nor good-for-nothing, tho’
I am sorry to say it myself; but that is because here is no one to say
it for me, or I assure you, if I thought it worth convincing you, I
could find vouchers enough. Are you satisfied, Miss Nancy? am I good
for nothing or something?’ ‘Oh! quite satisfied my dear Bro’ that you
are good for something&mdash;nay, for that matter very good.’ ‘Well, now,
that is prettily said, and as becomes you; faith, you wou’d always
talk in that manner, if you knew what charms it diffused o’er your
countenance. I think that prettily said, too, &amp; now I am even with
you. I hate compliments; but to dispel a lady’s frowns, &amp; get out of
the gloom, I would swear, lie, compliment, or do anything. Now we have
shook hands, &amp; are upon a good footing again, I must tell you I have
had very good health of late, &amp; have made too much use of it; have
worked very hard, have finished my Smith’s Shop&mdash;’tis as good or better
than the last. Have upon the Stocks the young Nobleman, whose avarice
caused him to break open the Tomb of his ancestors, in hopes of finding
vast treasures, from an inscription there was upon it&mdash;“In this tomb
is a greater treasure than Crœsus possessed.” This, I think, will be a
favourite picture. Burdett’s tour to France proves highly advantageous
to him. He is to etch plates for Wedgewood &amp; Bentley to be printed
upon their ware&mdash;an employ that in all probability will last him for
life&mdash;by which he will or may make four or six hundred a year. I know
your honest heart will make your pulse beat high at the news.’”</p>

<p>Farrington tells us that while Reynolds resided in St. Martin’s Lane,
his prices for portraits were&mdash;three-quarters, ten guineas; half
length, twenty guineas; whole length, forty guineas. Those of his
master, Hudson, were rather higher, and were soon adopted by him. About
four or five years later, both raised their prices to fifteen, thirty,
and sixty guineas for the three classes of portraits respectively.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Wright’s prices in 1754, when he was twenty years of age, were for
three-quarters, six guineas; half-length, twelve guineas; and full
length, twenty-six guineas. In 1760 we find them raised respectively
to ten, twenty-one, forty, and sixty guineas. Later in life they were
still further advanced to 90 and 120 guineas for full-lengths.</p>

<p>It has often been lamented that artists did not more frequently leave
behind them a record of their method of working, and the arrangement
of their palette, for the benefit of their brethren who follow them,
so that after a lapse of time the good results from their method of
working might be followed, and their failures, by the use of certain
pigments, be avoided. We are enabled to transcribe from Wright’s MS.
note-book the arrangement of his palette. As the present state of his
paintings, where they have not been “restored,” is generally very good,
after the lapse of a century, with the exception here and there of a
change of tone not intended by the artist, his “palette” may be worth
the attention of art students.</p>

<p>In the same MS. book, on the first page, is the following record of the
palette of another artist, and it is probable that Wright may have used
it in his early works:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center p-left p1">“<i>Mr. Phelps’s way of making a Pallet.</i></p>

<p>“First lay on Naples yellow, light oker, brown oker, Roman oker, Indian
Red, lake, brown pink, Ivory black, &amp; Prussian blue.</p>

<p>“In the light part of the face use Naples yellow, light oker, white,
vermillion, and a very little lake. Obs<sup>e</sup> that Naples yellow must be
tempered with an ivory pallet knife. For greenish shadows in the face,
use Naples yellow, Brown pink, lake, &amp; a little black.</p>

<p>“As blue black is a colour that will not stand, the following colours
are the same when mixt together:&mdash;Ivory black, Prussian blue, &amp; a
little white. So for Coleus earth, use ivory black, Roman oker, brown
pink, &amp; a little lake.”</p>

<p>Wright often used a twilled canvas for his portraits, and sometimes for
his landscapes. He mostly painted very thinly, and it is perhaps partly
in consequence of this practice that his pictures have stood the test
of time better than those of many contemporary artists. He but seldom
signed his paintings; when he did, he generally gave the initials, “I.
W., pinxit,” and the dates.</p>

<p>His early portraits partake very much of the hard handling and stiff
style of Hudson, his master; but as time elapsed and experience was
gained, he adopted more pleasing and original treatment.</p>

<p>In the early part of this century, an artist, Rawlinson by name, who
resided at Matlock Bath, copied some of Wright’s pictures with some
success.</p>

<p>On Oct. 6th, 1777, Wright and his family returned to Derby from Bath,
and went to lodge at Mr. Eley’s, which was opposite to his brother
Richard’s house, where he still continued to paint. There he lived very
happily and cheerfully, being constantly employed in the evening. When
not in the painting-rooms he would read, draw, play upon the flute, or
romp with his children; he was so pleasant and accommodating to all the
family, that though the Eleys were at first unwilling to receive him,
they quite lamented when he left.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1779, Wright removed to St. Helen’s House. This house
was built by the Fitzherberts, upon the same plan, and apparently
by the same architect, as Somersal Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> Staffordshire. Alleyne
Fitzherbert, who was created Baron St. Helen’s in 1801, was born in
this house, and from it took his title. The ground formerly belonged
to the Abbey of St. Helen, and on the old house being taken down, a
skeleton and numerous bones were found under the foundations, which
lead to the supposition that it was the burial ground of the Abbey; its
site is at the present time occupied by part of St. Helen’s Street, and
Messrs. Hall’s Marble Works. The present St. Helen’s, now the Grammar
School, is on the opposite side of King Street, and was built by&mdash;&mdash;
Gisborne, Esq. The comparatively retired situation of this old house
on the outskirts of the town, suited Wright. It had a large court
before it, and the sitting rooms looked into the gardens, which were
large. Wright always encouraged his children in the enjoyment of active
amusements, as being conducive to health. “The broad gravel walk,
the length of the largest garden,” writes his niece, “was a famous
place for playing at ball, baseball, &amp;c., in which his nieces used to
join with delight, there being no fear of any injury being done. The
old house was well calculated for all sorts of games; from the rooms
opening into each other and into different passages, no place could
be better for hide and seek, and the large hall for blind-man’s-buff,
and games that required space. Swinging was likewise a great pleasure.
There was not any part of the house in which they might not play, and
they could even whip tops in the room where the pictures were arranged
all round, and upon the floor.”</p>

     alt="" />
     <p class="p0 center p-left sm">ST. HELEN’S HOUSE IN 1792.</p>
  </div>

<p class="p2">Wright would allow them to play in his painting-room when he was not
employed, and his niece does not remember him being afraid of anything
being damaged, except when he was painting the portrait of Sir Richard
Arkwright, in which the machine he constructed for spinning cotton was
introduced; then he would not allow anyone to go near the table lest it
should be injured.</p>

<p>The painting-rooms at St. Helen’s House were not so convenient as those
at his brother’s, Dr. Wright’s, in the Iron Gate, where one room opened
into the other, so that by darkening the one room he could introduce
the proper light and subject he intended to paint, and view them to
advantage from the other room. His mechanical genius, however, enabled
him to construct an apparatus for painting candle-light pieces and
effects of fire-light. It consisted of a framework of wood resembling
a large folding screen, which reached to the top of the room, the two
ends being placed against the wall, which formed two sides of the
enclosure. Each fold was divided into compartments, forming a framework
covered with black paper, and opening with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> hinges, so that when the
object he was painting from was placed within with the proper light,
the artist could view it from various points from without.</p>

<p>In a note to a poem on the Chauntry House, Newark, by the Rev. H. N.
Bousfield, B.A., the following anecdote occurs:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Banqueting, or Dining Room of the Chauntry, contains a strong,
but delicately handled, lengthened portrait of the late Joseph Sikes,
Esq., by the celebrated Mr. Wright, of St. Helen’s, in Derby, the
ancient residence of Mr. Sikes’s family, at an early period of whose
minority that venerable edifice was, to his deep regret, taken down,
and which contained, among other characteristics of “Olden Times,” a
compact Chapel, part of which had a curiously wrought cedar wainscot. A
remarkable proof of the success of the artist in giving to ‘canvas face
and figure,’ was afforded by a favourite little terrier dog of the late
Mr. Sikes’s unconsciously accompanying him into the apartment at St.
Helen’s, upon the <i>floor</i> of which, in a very <i>unfinished</i> state, were
arranged, with many others, this Portrait and that of his first Lady,
the delightful sagacity of that interesting class of animals quickly
displaying itself by an attentive survey of the picture, and by the
most lively emotions of gratification, to the extent even of actually
<i>licking</i> the canvas. The alarm and astonishment, however, so naturally
felt by Mr. Sikes from this honest though uncourteous intruder,
was strongly reproved by Mr. Wright, as the most unprecedented and
unflattering respect he could have received; adding, that if the
<i>finish</i> of the painting was as perfect as the compliment of the dog,
his highest ambition must be exceeded, and if anyone took the trouble
to write his life, that anecdote would necessarily form a prominent
place. It has been aptly observed, that it more than rivals the
celebrated and well-known story of Alexander and Apelles.”</p>

<p>This dog was not singular in paying such an unintentional compliment
to the artist, as the following authenticated anecdote shows:&mdash;“In
October, 1782, Mr. Wright was engaged painting the portrait of a young
gentleman named Carleill, and to try the effect in a strong light, the
picture was placed on the floor, with its back resting against the
legs of a chair, when a favourite greyhound, belonging to the family,
coming into the room, bounded up to the picture and began to lick the
face. Hereupon Mrs. Carleill, who was present, apologised to the artist
for the animal’s misbehaviour, but Wright, shaking hands with her,
exclaimed, ‘Oh! Mrs. Carleill, I freely forgive the dog the injury
he has done to the painting for the compliment he has paid me.’” Nor
were human beings exempt from similar deceptions. It is related that
Mrs. Morewood, of Alfreton Hall, went with her friend, Mr. Holland,
of Ford House, to see some paintings at Wright’s rooms; when looking
at the portraits of the three children of Mr. Walter Synnott, grouped
in the act of letting a dove fly from a wickerwork birdcage which was
introduced in the foreground, she desired Mr. Holland would remove the
birdcage, as it obstructed her view of the lower part of the picture;
it is almost needless to add that the cage was painted and not of
wickerwork, and that Wright thanked the lady for the compliment she had
thus unconsciously paid him. At another time, a man who had occasion
to enter the painting-room when the picture of the Old Man and his Ass
(from Sterne) stood upon the floor, tried to kick away the saddle, so
as to obtain a better view of the picture. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> on another occasion,
it is said, a gentleman on entering the room, bowed to the full-length
portrait of the late Mr. Charles Hurt, of Wirksworth, which was placed
near the fire to dry, thinking it was Mr. Hurt himself who was in the
room.</p>

<p>With reference to his art-enemies alluded to in the early part of
this chapter, it is a pleasant task to record the following pleasing
anecdote of Wilson, to show that artists may be “great yet amicable
rivals”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wilson was liberal to his brother artists, and reverenced the
powers of Wright, of Derby, highly, with whom he was intimate. The
latter artist esteemed highly the abilities of Wilson, and when he
was in London, rarely failed to visit his great but amicable rival.
In conversing familiarly one day upon the subject of their art,
Wright proposed to exchange one of his pictures for one of Wilson’s;
the latter assented with the easy consciousness of his particular
excellence, as distinguished from the particular excellence of his
friend: ‘With all my heart, Wright; I’ll give you <i>air</i>, and you’ll
give me <i>fire</i>.’ It is known that in aerial effect Wilson considered
himself above every rival; and the proposal of Wright may be supposed
to imply, on his part, an ingenuous acknowledgment of Wilson’s
superiority in this particular. I have never heard that Wilson imitated
Wright, but we know that Wright avowedly imitated Wilson, and, in such
instances, reached his glow and aerial effect to admiration.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Holland, an intimate friend of Wright, and afterwards one of his
executors, wrote the following intelligible but somewhat incoherent
note on the margin of a catalogue of Wright’s paintings exhibited in
London:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Richard Wilson is certainly the first in Landscape (1767). Joseph
Wright should not be called second, because in a procession I would
have them pair, and go hand-in-hand; and were there two right hand
sides, they should both, from their excellence, have them. But this
only in Landscape Procession. Wilson’s forte was only Landscape: look
forward to the variety of the latter, in all of which he excelled;
and in an academy he should have not only one of the foremost, but a
distinguished bench to himself.”</p>

<p>Another brother artist who became a patron of Wright’s was Bacon the
Sculptor, who purchased a small Vesuvius, which was exhibited at the
Great Piazza, London, and afterwards engraved by Byrne.</p>

<p>The following anecdotes and notes, though not relevant to Wright’s
remarkable imitative power, may as well find a place at the end of this
chapter.</p>

<p>The Curator of the Derby Art Gallery tells a good tale of a north
Derbyshire farmer’s visit to the Gallery when the Wright Collection was
being exhibited in 1883. The farmer and his wife were standing before
the picture of a boy blowing a bladder; he was saying to his spouse in
the Derbyshire dialect, “Ah tell yer t’blither iz put behind t’picter,
that’ns a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> raal blither.” The wife replied that it was only a painted
bladder. He then turned round and appealed to the Curator, who had just
entered the gallery, who assured him that the bladder was painted upon
the canvas, whereupon the farmer became most indignant, and replied,
“Doan’t yer think I knows a blither when ah seez un?”</p>

     <p class="p0 center p-left sm">BOY BLOWING A BLADDER.</p>
  </div>

<p class="p2">On one occasion, Wright was vexed with a sitter so capricious and
unreasonable, that his patience and ingenuity were sorely taxed. She
came to her second sitting in a different dress to that she had worn
at the first, and desired the painter to represent her as she then
appeared. Wright altered the picture to suit her whim. To his surprise
and annoyance, when she next made her appearance, it was in a third
dress. Again the pliant artist obliged her. When, however, she appeared
in a fourth dress, Wright could stand it no longer, and flatly refused
to make any further alteration. The lady replied in a threat to leave
the portrait on his hands. “Madam,” retorted the painter, “I do not
wish you to have the painting, I shall put it into the first auction
sale, and it will fetch more than I was about to charge you.” This had
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> desired result; the picture was taken, but the drapery was painted
over by another artist, named Barber, to suit the caprice of the lady.</p>

<p>A lady who was about to sit to Mr. Wright, was told by her friends that
Mr. Wright would arrange her hair, &amp;c. She, to enable him to carry this
into effect, spread out upon the table a large assortment of brushes,
combs, pomades, bandoline, &amp;c., much to the astonishment and amusement
of the artist.</p>

<p>A sitter, a lady, who, though possessed of a fine figure, and good
arms and ankles, had but an indifferent face, puzzled Mr. Wright as
to the position in which he should place her. After some thought he
chose to paint her extending her beautiful bare arm towards a branch
of a hawthorn tree. Showing only sufficient of the lady’s face to be
recognisable, he brought the full contour of her handsome figure into
view, with one pretty foot and ankle peeping out from under her dress,
and thus produced what was at once a good portrait and pleasing picture.</p>

<p>From the foregoing description, it is most probable that the following
advertisement which appeared in the “Times” newspaper of July 25th,
1871, refers to the same picture, and that Mrs. Woodville was the
sitter.</p>

<blockquote class="narrow sm">

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="p-left">The above reward will be paid for the Portrait in Oil of the
late Mrs. Woodville, by Wright, of Derby. The size is about
7 feet 6 inches by 4 feet 6 inches. She is attired in white,
and represented as climbing up a bank to gather hawthorne. Her
feet and ankles are displayed, and her shoes ornamented with
garnet buckles. The picture is believed never to have been
framed, and from being constantly rolled up to be considerably
cracked.</p>

<p>&mdash;Apply to Messrs. SIMPSON &amp; NORTH,</p>

<p class="left1">Solicitors, 1, Rumford Street,</p>

<p class="left2">Liverpool.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon further enquiry I find that Major Orred, of Tranmere and Weston,
Cheshire, caused the reward to be offered, and succeeded in finding
the portrait at a Chemist’s, in Liverpool, but it was unfortunately
mutilated by being cut down from whole length to “Kit-cat.”</p>

<p>In “Mozley’s Reminiscences,” p. 65, the following allusion is made to
Wright:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There are men who are interesting from their associations, but whom
no associations can redeem. Such was Joseph Pickford. I first became
acquainted with his figure and circumstances at Derby, in 1815. His
father had been an architect and builder, and the intimate friend of
Wright the painter, remarkable for his illustrations of the varieties
of light and their effects; and also of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> Whitehurst, a mechanician and
author of a ‘Theory of the Earth.’ It was a coterie contemporaneous and
on friendly terms with the Philosophical Society, founded by Erasmus
Darwin, but with a different caste, for philosophers are, socially,
as exclusive as other people. The father had built in the Friar Gate
a house of some architectural pretensions, his <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>, people
said. The sons had divided it. He occupied the smaller portion, entered
by a side door, much as it had come from the builder’s hands. The only
pretty thing in his sitting room was a charming picture by Wright, of
Pickford and his brother playing with a spaniel, of the date 1775, I
should think, and in the gay costume of that period. It passed into the
hands of a branch of the Curzon family. When I called on Pickford it
was a caution to see what a beautiful child might come to.”</p>

<p>Woodward (G. W.), the Caricaturist (himself a Derbyshire man), says in
his “Eccentric Excursions,” “It would be unpardonable to leave Derby
without noticing the celebrated artist, Mr. Wright, who has resided
several years in a house<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> facing the New Inn, overgrown with ivy,
which, together with its high walls, proclaims an habitation sacred
to study and retirement. The result of his labours are always open to
the inspection of the stranger, an indulgence characteristic of this
gentleman’s well-known affability; and those who depart unpleased
after viewing his Moon and Candle-light pieces, and other inimitable
specimens of his pencil, must indeed be void of taste and judgment in
the imitative arts.”</p>

<p>In Wright’s account-book is the following entry:&mdash;“An account of the
Trees in Windmill pit close in the year 1783, when eight trees on
Shaw’s side, six on the Normanton lane, and ten on the road side, in
all 24 trees.” From this entry we learn that the historical “Windmill
Pit”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> close (where Joan Waste<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> was burnt at the stake in 1556)
at that time belonged to Wright, and that he planted the trees which
adorned that once pretty spot, but which have had to fall before the
march of the mason and bricklayer. The annual rent of the close at that
date was £20.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I now propose to deal with the uncommon instance of an artist who,
after having accepted the Associateship, refused the full honours
of the Royal Academy. In November of 1781, Wright was elected an
Associate, and in February, 1784, a full member of the Academy, but for
some reason or other he declined to become an Academician. Much has
been written upon this subject, and very different conclusions have
been arrived at.</p>

<p>One of his most intimate friends, J. Leigh Philips, who possessed
considerable artistic judgment, wrote in 1797&mdash;the year after Wright’s
death&mdash;the following account of Wright’s treatment by the Royal
Academy, and there is no doubt but that he was well acquainted with all
the circumstances of the case:&mdash;</p>

<p>“His portraits are mostly confined to the immediate neighbourhood
of Derby; this remark may likewise in a great degree extend to the
generality of his works, as but few of his late pictures have been
publicly exhibited, owing to their being frequently disposed of even
before finished, and to a repugnance which he felt at sending his works
to an exhibition where he had too much cause to complain of their
being improperly placed, and sometimes even upon the ground, that, if
possible, they might escape the public eye. As a proof of the truth
of this remark, the last pictures he exhibited were <i>placed upon the
ground</i>. In consequence of which they were so much injured by the feet
of the company, as to render it necessary to have the frames repaired
and re-gilded. This narrow jealousy, added to the circumstance of his
being rejected as an R.A. at the time Mr. Garvey was a successful
candidate, did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> tend to increase his opinion of the liberality of
his brethren in the profession. The Academy, however, being afterwards
made aware of the impropriety of thus insulting a man of his abilities,
deputed their Secretary, Newton, to Derby, to solicit his acceptance
of a diploma, which he indignantly rejected, knowing how little the
institution could serve him, and feeling perhaps a satisfaction that
his friend Mortimer and himself were both deemed equally unqualified to
enjoy the honours attached to that Royal establishment.”</p>

<p>The Messrs. Redgrave, in their “Century of Painters,” “take exception
to this account of the treatment of Wright by the Academy,” and say,
“We are inclined to discount the whole of the tale” upon the grounds
that “we have searched the records of the Academy to learn the facts
connected with Wright’s retirement.” It was a safe place to search for
what was sure not to be found, if Mr. Philips’ account were true.</p>

<p>Against the authors of the “Century of Painters” are arrayed
the writers and poets of the day, who took up the case when the
circumstances were well known. If Wright felt aggrieved, he had a
perfect right to decline the honour; and it appears to me that the
story as told by Mr. Philips has more claim to credence than the
opinions of writers a century later, founded upon such purely negative
evidence.</p>

<p>The Messrs. Redgrave also state that “he then (when offered the full
diploma) refused to comply with the law of the Academy, which requires
a member to present one of his works to the Academy before receiving
his diploma, and required his name to be removed from the list of
Associates.” As Wright declined the proffered honour, it was not
necessary for him to “comply with the law of the Academy, and present
one of his works.” The refusal was consequent upon his retirement, but
there is nothing to show that it caused it.</p>

<p>Again, Mr. S. Redgrave, in his “Dictionary of Artists,” states&mdash;“On
the foundation of the Academy he had entered as a student, and in 1781
he was elected an Associate; his election as a full member followed
in 1784. But we are told that, annoyed by another having been elected
before him, he retired altogether from the Academy. The facts, however,
do not bear out this statement, and it appears more probable that the
nervous, irritable, ailing painter, settled quietly so far from the
Metropolis, was afraid of the duties and responsibilities which his
membership would entail.” It will be seen that Mr. S. Redgrave omits to
state the “facts” to which he refers.</p>

<p>The retirement of Wright from the Academy induced Hayley, the Poet,
to write the following Ode, with a view to “Guard him from meek
depression’s chill controul”:&mdash;</p>

<p>The first nine verses allude to Wright’s picture of the Siege of
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The last three refer to his having been rejected as an R.A.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>This “Ode” is referred to by Wright in the following interesting letter
to his friend Hayley; and from what we learn of Wright’s character from
those who knew him, it is very certain that he would not have accepted
as a “very ingenious and very friendly ode” a poem which contained such
severe animadversions upon the treatment he had been subjected to by
the Royal Academy, unless he had thought them justified by the facts:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="r1">“Derby, Aug. 31st, 1783.</p>

<p class="smcap">“My Dear Sir,</p>

<p class="left3">“It is recommended to the painters who wish to become eminent,
to let no day pass without a line. How contrary, alas! has
been my practice; a series of ill-health for these sixteen
years past (the core of my life) has subjected me to many idle
days, and bowed down my attempts towards fame and fortune.
I have laboured under an annual malady some years, four and
five months at a time; under the influence of which I have
now dragged over four months, without feeling a wish to take
up my pencil, till roused by your very ingenious and very
friendly Ode, in which are many beautiful parts, and some
sublime. Perhaps, had I then been furnished with proper
materials for the action off Gibraltar, I should have begun my
fire; but for want of such instructions, I soon sunk into my
wonted torpor again, from which, as the weather grows cooler,
I hope to awaken. Mr. Wedgwood approves of your subject of
Penelope, as a companion to the Maid of Corinth. You mention
the boy Telemachus being pale and feverish; pray, is there any
authority in history for it? or have you mentioned it to give
more character and expression to his mother? When I know this
I shall make a sketch of it, and consult you further about it.
Some little time ago, I received one hundred copies of your
charming Ode (would I deserved what your warm friendship has
lavished on me), some of which I distributed among my friends;
but would it not be more advantageous to me to spread abroad
the rest when my picture is finished&mdash;especially if I make an
exhibition of it with some others?</p>

<p class="left1">“I am, dear Sir, with the greatest esteem,</p>

<p class="left2">“Your much obliged Friend,</p>

<p class="r1">“J. WRIGHT.”</p></blockquote>


<p class="p1h">Another writer, Anthony Pasquin,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
in his “The Royal Academicians: A Farce, 1786,” gives this account of
Wright’s secession from the Academy, which he puts into the mouth of
Truth:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The inimitable Wright, of Derby, once expressed an ardent desire
to be admitted a member of the Academy, but from what unaccountable
reason his wishes were frustrated remains as yet a secret to the
world; but the sagacious, or, rather, the envious brethren of the
brush thought proper to thrust so eminent an artist on one side to
make way for so contemptible an animal as Edmund Garbage (Garvey).
They had scarcely invested this insignificant mushroom with diplomatic
honours before they discovered that they had been committing a most
atrocious, diabolical, and bloody murder upon two gentlemen of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
respectability and character, ycleped Genius and Justice; and the
pangs of their wounded consciences became so very troublesome, that
it was resolved, in a full divan, instantly to despatch Secretary
Prig to Derby with the diploma, and force these august privileges
and distinctions upon the disappointed painter, that he had before
solicited in vain. But, alas! the expedition was inauspicious and
unfortunate; the diploma was rejected with the most evident marks of
contempt, and the Secretary kicked as a recompense for his presumption.”</p>

<p>This account is, no doubt, a caricature of what actually took place,
but it to a certain extent corroborates both Mr. Philips’ statement and
the Poet Hayley’s allusions to the same event in his ode; and we must
remember that the poet was also one of Wright’s intimate friends.</p>

<p>Mr. F. G. Stephens has kindly called my attention to the following
extract from “Number 1: A Liberal Critique on the Exhibition for 1794,”
by “Anthony Pasquin” (Williams), p. 15:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center p-left">J. WRIGHT, DERBY.</p>

<p class="center p-left">No. 107, “<i>An Eruption of Vesuvius</i>.”</p>

<p class="center p-left">No. 232, “<i>A Lake at Dunkeld, in Scotland, Evening</i>,” <i>by the
same Author</i>.</p>

<p class="center p-left">No. 233, “<i>A Village on Fire</i>,” <i>by ditto</i>.</p>

<p class="p1h">“This truly celebrated Artist has honoured the Institution
by condescending to mingle his choice labours with the <i>Harp
Alley</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> excellence of a majority of the Royal Academicians.
Feeling their importance so inordinately, it moves my wonder
that these uplifted gentlemen do not eagerly contribute,
by their own efforts, to the support of that order from
whence they derive such prodigious importance, and not give
the cavilling world occasion to remark that they have been
honoured without desert, and retain the mummeries of the
institution without gratitude. When I was in Paris, in 1787,
they managed those affairs much better; the Royal Academy of
Polite Arts there was conducted more nobly: every person was
admitted to view <i>gratis</i>, what was meant as a free display
of national genius, for national admiration. With us the
motive seems cupidity, and the end deception. With the richest
Monarch in Europe for their patron, the arts of England are
literally kept from destruction by the votive shillings of
a motley public, who pay the salaries of the professors,
and find <i>oil</i> for the lamps in the <i>plaister</i> and <i>living</i>
schools, though the King arrogates the character of being the
high supporter of the system. But it is a provident assumption
of dignity, unaccompanied with either risk, anxiety, or
expense! He seems to possess the <i>furor</i> of patronage as
highly as the tenth Leo, but I have as yet to learn that he is
equally munificent.”</p></blockquote>

<p>My own opinion is, that the facts as recorded by these writers were
in the main correct. There seems no reason to doubt that Wright’s
contributions to the annual Exhibitions at the Academy had been
systematically placed in bad positions, and that he felt his abilities
deserved recognition before those of Mr. E. Garvey, his competitor
at the time, whose works consisted principally of small pictures of
gentlemen’s seats. At this period, the Elections at the Royal Academy
were contested, and interest was all-powerful; and nothing would have
been more repugnant to the sensitive and honourable nature of Wright,
than having to pass through the ordeal of canvassing for an election,
where merit alone should have been the test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to be regretted that no letters or other memoranda are to be
found amongst Wright’s papers which throw any light upon his refusal of
the diploma in 1784.</p>

<p>I am, however, able to give, in Wright’s own words, his version of his
treatment by the Royal Academy during the years 1790, 1791, and 1794.
From these letters we learn that Wright had again become an exhibitor
in the Academy, but that his pictures were badly hung. This treatment
calls forth these words from him:&mdash;“’Tis not the first instance of
their base conduct. I have been driven from their Exhibition before,
and must again withdraw myself, unless I could brook such abuse.”</p>


<p>Again, in writing to Mr. Philips, in 1794, he says:&mdash;“Your
picture of Vesuvius and one at Dunkeld which would have been at
Manchester before now, had not the frames of the pictures which I
exhibited been materially damaged at the Academy. Mr. Milbourne has
orders to put them into good condition and send them to you when
done.”</p>

<p>This is alone sufficient to prove his retirement had some deeper ground
than a disinclination to present a diploma picture.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="r1">“Derby, 11th June, 1790.</p>

<p class="smcap">“To John Leigh Philips,</p>

<p class="left3">“My good friend, for so I have reason to call you, is ever

villany, and what an artist should sink under the reflection
of. I wish the Town had held together longer; I should have
been very glad to have their behaviour publickly known, while
it is recent, that if I should exhibit no more with them, the
true reason may be known. I was prophet enough to foretell
what would happen to me. I think I communicated it to Tate,
indeed it required no divination, to know the miscreants and
their dependency on the Alderman,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> was to know the result
of all. I am sorry the business is protracted from time to
time. The Editors stand much in awe of this great man. I heard
the other day from a Relation of the Alderman’s, that the
editor of the Morning Herald had a violent quarrel with him
for rejecting the performance of a relation of his as unworthy
of his gallery. There is an odd paragraph in the Leicester
papers. ‘The <i>Prince</i> of pick-pockets has given instruction
to his attorney to prosecute a printer for a libel on his
<i>character</i>.’ Can you guess who it is? I wonder Vasari has
not yet come out with his statement of facts, sure he has not
plugged with gold the touch hole of his great guns. At present
I can but thank you for your very friendly services to me; I
feel the weight of such <i>solid obligations</i>.</p>

happy to receive any pictures from me, but they wish to
avoid inserting anything in the catalogue, that may appear
like altercation with the R Academy, and they conceive it
sufficient to mention in the catalogue, that the two pictures
from Shakespeare were exhibited last year at Somerset house,
timely notice not having been sent of the Exhibition of this
Society, but the subjects having received alterations, Mr.
Wright wishes them to be exhibited here. However in this
respect the Committee will be wholly guided by me. I think
nothing had better be said than the above. My wish was to have
had something mentioned in the catalogue expressive of the
slight &amp; injustice shewn to my pictures last year by the R
Academy, by the obscure places they put them in, which I hope
will be an apology to the publick for their 2<sup>nd</sup> appearance.
Pray suggest something proper if you and my friend Tate think
some observation of the kind should be made.</p>

<p>“Heath &amp; Martin will have an opportunity of seeing these

do I know whether the two pictures of Romeo &amp; Juliet and the
Storm are to be marked in the Catalogue to be sold. It would
gratify my pride and resentment to the Alderman to have ’em
engraved by Heath&mdash;as the Companion of the Storm would become
more universal. The Society wish to have any single picture

unpleasant suggestions that might be started to the prejudice
of the Society. Pray give me your thoughts by return of post,

<p>The note in the catalogue of 1791, the last exhibition of the Society,
thus reads:&mdash;“N.B.&mdash;The above pictures were exhibited last year in the

reason to accommodate me. They approve of the N.B., as it now

it, as in their opinion it sets me in perhaps too pointed a
view of opposition to the R.A., but I don’t see that. They
have repeatedly used me ill, and the public ought to know
it, or my changing the place of exhibition might be deemed
whimsicalness. The terms it is couched in are delicate, and
the supposition of delay, being ye cause of the pictures being

you like the addition to your Grotto, in my opinion ’tis much
improved by it; there is a better balance of light and shadow.
I would advise you to get it painted on the backside with a
greyish colour which will preserve it much. I mention grey
because the paint works thro’ like pin heads in any of the

<p>In a biography of Wright, I am compelled to notice the unwarrantable
attack made by the Messrs. Redgrave, in their “Century of Painters,”
upon the reputation of Wright as a painter. Whether this arose from
Wright’s seceding from the Academy, and so committing an unpardonable
offence in the eyes of the Messrs. Redgrave, or from the fact that they
judged Wright by unimportant works, as I shall presently show, or from
both combined, I must leave the reader to decide.</p>


<p>Messrs. Redgrave state:&mdash;“Having made
a journey into the County especially to see some of the works of this
Derbyshire artist, we were shown many, both portraits, landscapes,
and figure subjects, reported to be amongst his best, but always
disappointing to our expectations.” Soon after the publication of the
“Century of Painters,” I was at the trouble to make enquiries as to
what pictures had been seen by the Messrs. Redgrave on the occasion
of this visit, and found that they had not seen his best pictures at
all, but only a few which were either left unfinished at his death
or had been tampered with by others, together with some unimportant
works. They did not see “The Orrery,” “The Gladiator,” “The Alchymist,”
nor any of his important portraits or “conversation” pictures. The
“Air Pump” picture was apparently not seen by them until later, when
a portion of their criticisms had been written, and it then received
encomium from them, which I now place in juxtaposition with what they
had written a few pages before. The italics are mine.</p>

<p class="center p-left p1h">JOS. WRIGHT, OF DERBY.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>“As a portrait painter, judged by his best works, he was
merely respectable. There is a painful solidity of execution,
<i>a want of quality and texture both in the flesh and
draperies</i>, so that when placed beside the works of Reynolds
or Gainsboro’ his portraits remind us of the labours of the
<i>house painter</i>; they show little variety of handling; <i>flesh,
drapery, sky, trees, all being executed in the same painty
manner</i>.”&mdash;“Century of Painters,” vol. 1, p. 258.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p class="p1h">CRITICISMS ON THE PICTURE CALLED “AN EXPERIMENT WITH AN AIR PUMP.”</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>“We certainly should have placed Wright of Derby <i>much lower
as an artist</i> had we not seen this <i>very clever work</i>.... The
drawing and composition is satisfactory, and there is a great
contrast in the expression and the varied attitudes of the
several heads. <i>The flesh of the faces is good in colour, and
most carefully modelled</i>; indeed the young woman on the right,
in blue, and the lad drawing down a curtain to shut out the
moonlight on the left, are worth special observation for this
quality. <i>The draperies are all carefully painted from nature
(a merit apparent also in most of Wright’s portraits)</i>, and
are in this respect very different from the sloppy negligence
of some of the followers of Reynolds. There is a pretty
little incident rendered with feeling and true expression,
in the group of two young girls touched with childish sorrow
and dread of what they are told is to be the result of ‘the
experiment’&mdash;the death of the bird confined in the glass
receiver of the machine.</p>

<p>“The colour of the whole is pleasant, the execution firm
and <i>solid</i>, and the brown shadows, although dark, are
sufficiently rich and luminous, the picture very agreeable in
general tone.”&mdash;“Century of Painters,” vol. 1, p. 264.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. R. Redgrave, R.A., in a letter to the writer, dated Nov. 30, 1861,
wrote:&mdash;“I have seen on my journey and since, <i>very many fine Wrights</i>,
and have reported to the Commissioners (International Exhibition) on
six or eight, which they intend to ask or have asked for.” It is a
difficult task to reconcile this statement with the “house painter”
theory. Yet the “Century of Painters” was not published until 1866.</p>

<p>Of the picture of “An Experiment with an Air Pump,” which called
forth such praise from the Messrs. Redgrave, I am enabled, through
the courtesy of the Proprietors of the “Art Journal,” to give an
illustration. It was presented to the National Gallery, a few years
ago, by Mr. Walter Tyrrell.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">We have seen that Wright’s visit to Italy caused him to turn his
attention to landscape, and it is after his return from thence that we
find him entering upon the treatment of poetical subjects. “Edwin,”
from Beattie’s “Minstrel,” and “Maria,” from Sterne’s sentimental
journey, were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1778 and 1781, and were
portraits of living persons, who were eminently fitted to represent
the ideal of the authors. Before Wright commenced to paint “Edwin
the Minstrel,” he wrote to Dr. Beattie to ask his opinion upon the
treatment of the subject. The Doctor wrote a very excellent letter in
reply, and concluded by saying, “Edwin from your pencil will be all my
pen vainly endeavoured to make him.” A Derby gentleman, Thos. Haden,
surgeon, who was considered to be one of the handsomest men in the town
at that date, sat for this picture. The lady who sat for “Maria” was a
Mrs. Bassano, of Derby.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mr. F. Seymour Haden for kindly allowing me to
embellish this volume with his admirable etching of “Edwin the
Minstrel.”</p>

<p>We may well attribute these and some other pictures of a sentimental
character to the influence of Wright’s visit to Italy. Wright was
evidently indebted for the attitude of the figure in the picture of
“The Captive” to Michael Angelo’s “Adam” in the Capella Sistina.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> This
picture was painted in Rome, and sent to England. A very good tale is
told about it, which is here inserted from “The Universal Magazine” of
June, 1795:&mdash;</p>


<p>“When this celebrated painter (Wright, of Derby) was at Rome,
he painted that very fine figure, “The Captive,” from Sterne, and
consigned the picture to a friend in London, who having advice of its
being landed, and deposited in the Custom House, presented a petition
to the Board, stating that it was a portrait painted by an English
artist, and praying it might be delivered duty free. In answer to this
he received an order to attend on a given day, and was brought before
their honours. The picture was produced, and the first question asked
was, “Of whom is it the portrait?” The gentleman replied with truth, it
was the portrait of a Roman (for it was copied from a Roman beggar),
and the Board seemed inclined to let it pass; but an old gentleman, who
had long been a Commissioner, made a shrewd objection, and remarked
that this was such a portrait as he had never before seen in his life,
and taken in a manner that he did not believe either Roman, Greek,
Turk, Jew, or Infidel, would ever consent to ‘sit.’ ‘If,’ he added,
‘any gentleman at this Honourable Board chose to have his picture
drawn, would not he put on a clean shirt, and have his wig fresh
powdered, and be clean shaved; answer me that? To be sure he would.
Now, it is here pretended, that this fellow sat for his portrait, who
had hardly a rag to cover his nakedness; gentlemen, if he could have
afforded to have paid for painting his picture, he could have afforded
to buy himself a pair of breeches!’ He added by moving that the duty
might be paid; and the duty was paid accordingly.”</p>

<p>Wright was more fortunate when he returned from Italy, as to payment of
Custom House duties, as the following extract from a letter from Bath,
dated 4th Dec., 1775, shows:&mdash;“Through the interest &amp; application of my
friend Mr. Baxter, I have got my pictures, &amp;c., duty free, a thing so
unusual the clerks cou’d scarce credit it. I believe it an indulgence
none have experienced but myself. Had I been charged with ye common
duty, I should have had near £30 to pay, an object this at any time, at
the present a very material one.”</p>

<p>From the pictures of this character, we must not omit to mention
that of the “Dead Soldier,” from Langhorne’s poems, which has become so
familiar through the excellent line engraving by Heath.</p>

<p>It is related that Wright said before he painted the “Dead Soldier,”
that he would depict the greatest possible sorrow, yet there should be
a smiling face in the picture. The following lines by William Sotheby,
F.R.S., bear testimony to the realisation of his intention:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ileft">“I, to yon lonely tent by pity led,</div>
        <div>View where the widow mourns her soldier, dead;</div>
        <div>Turns from her babe, whose careless smiles impart</div>
        <div>Strange woe, that harrows up the mother’s heart,</div>
        <div>Hangs o’er the body, bleeding on the ground,</div>
        <div>Clasps his cold hand, and faints upon the wound.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>The picture of the “Dead Soldier” was bought from the easel by Heath
for £105, who afterwards sold it to J. L. Philips. It was sold in
Manchester, when the effects of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> Patron of the Fine Arts came
to the hammer, by Winstanley and Taylor, in October, 1814, and then
realized £315. It is thus described in the Catalogue:&mdash;“Lot 33, Wright,
of Derby,&mdash;‘The Dead Soldier.’ This acknowledged <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of this
admired master, uniting great knowledge of grouping, excellent drawing,
&amp; correct colouring, with a fine feeling of sentiment, decidedly
proves the assertion of Mr. Fuzeli, in his ‘Biographical Notice of Mr.
Wright,’ that ‘he once eminently succeeded in the pathetic.’”</p>

<p>The line engraving by Heath appears, from the following correspondence,
to have been a great success.</p>

<p class="p1h">It has been the custom to view Wright
only as a painter of artificial light, and for picture dealers and
some others to attribute all unknown pictures of fire in any form to
“Wright of Derby.” We ourselves have seen many so attributed, which
would not add fame to any painter’s name. The Exhibition of Wright’s
Works in the Derby Corporation Art Gallery, in 1883, tended to dispel
this unfounded illusion as to the limits of Wright’s art. Whilst the
representation of fire-light in some form or other was undoubtedly a
speciality with Wright, this class of subjects, after all, formed but a
small proportion of the numerous works then collected together.</p>

<p>On reference being made to the appendix it will be noticed that there
were many other important works painted by Wright which were never
exhibited; and as he did not always sign his paintings, they may
possibly now be attributed to other artists, or to the great <i>unknown</i>.</p>

<p>A picture that created considerable attention at the time it was
painted, was the “Destruction of the Spanish Floating Batteries off
Gibraltar,” on September 13th, 1782,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> which was bought from the
easel by Mr. J. Milnes for £420, being the highest price Wright
obtained for a single picture. This was one of the works included in
the London Exhibition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> Wright’s pictures in the year 1785, and
a notice of the Press of that date thus alludes to it:&mdash;“We shall,
however, at different periods lay before our readers a particular
account of these noble productions as they stand in the catalogue:
except that grand scene of the ‘Destruction of the Floating Batteries
off Gibraltar,’ which we cannot resist the present impulse of
mentioning out of its turn. In this picture, Mr. Wright has represented
a view of the extensive scenery, combined with the action on the 13th
Sept., 1782, in which his design is sublime, and his colouring natural
and brilliant beyond description. We never remember to have seen
shadows painted so little like substance as those in the foreground,
which gain great strength and richness from the prodigious brightness
of the grand explosion at a distance; but we feel ourselves inadequate
to the task of pointing out the various merits of this phenomenon
in the imitative arts, which proves the painter is unique in the
extraordinary line of the charming study he has so happily pursued.”</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Extract from a Letter from Buxton Wells, January 3, 1785.</h3>

<p>“Governor Elliot’s successful defence of Gibraltar has, among the many
essential advantages accruing from it, been productive of some of the
noblest works in the Fine Arts, especially among the painters. On
stopping at Derby a few days since, I was introduced by a friend to
view the productions of that great genius Wright, whose astonishing
power of expressing artificial lights on canvas, the world has long
been acquainted with. His new picture on the Siege of Gibraltar, for
composition, force, brilliancy, and prodigious effect of fire, exceeds,
in my opinion, all his former labours. To attempt a description of it
would be in vain; whoever sees the picture must have such an idea of
the action as no poetry can describe. Mr. Wright has not been in the
Exhibition (for reasons I cannot explain) for some time past, but that
he will not withhold this sublime piece from general inspection, I most
sincerely hope, as the attack on Gibraltar, with some other pieces on
interesting subjects, would form an Exhibition in every way worthy of
the countenance of the public.”</p>

<p>The “Orrery” picture was exhibited at the Society of Artists’ Rooms,
in 1766, so must have been painted when Wright was thirty years old. It
was purchased by, and probably painted for, the Earl Ferrers, for the
sum of two hundred guineas; fifty pounds of this was paid on account,
and the remainder secured by a bond, of which a copy is given on the
next page.</p>

<p>The figures in the picture are all portraits, and various persons
have been mentioned as the probable originals who were thus honoured.
A copy of the print, once belonging to the artist, has certain names
written on the margin, with the date 1768, so that the following are
identified:&mdash;Jos. Wright, with his back towards the spectator, Mr.
Burdett taking notes, young Cantrell, Mr. A. Winterman, Mr. G. Snowden,
Mrs. Sale, and Mr. Denby as the philosopher.</p>

<p>Mr. Burdett also figures in the “Gladiator” picture. The other boy
sitter was a son of Earl Ferrers, as the following extract from the
“Stemmata Shirleiana” shows:&mdash;“Lawrence Rowland, 2nd Son of Robert
6th Earl of Ferrers, Bap. at St. Alkmund’s Derby, Nov. 3, 1757, d.
Feb. 5, 1773. His portrait when very young is preserved in Wright’s
celebrated picture of the ‘Orrery,’ well known from the engraving.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The picture passed from the hands of the Ferrers family, and was sold
by Mr. Thos. Rought, of London, to the late Mr. Francis Wright, of
Osmaston Manor, by Ashbourne, for the sum of fifty guineas, in 1853.
In 1884, at the dispersion of Mr. John Osmaston’s collection, to whom
the picture then belonged, it was again in the market, and it is with
pleasure that we are able to record that, being purchased by a few of
Wright’s admirers, singularly, at the original price of two hundred
guineas, it was on September 4th presented to the Derby Corporation Art
Gallery as a memorial to the painter, where it will remain as a fitting
record of the admirable powers he possessed, and be admired by his
fellow-townsmen in years to come.</p>

<p>The bond mentioned above was as follows:&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

<p style="clear: both;">From the following extract of a letter written by Wright to his brother
Richard, dated Rome, 13<sup>th</sup> Ap., 1774, we learn that Burdett’s
behaviour caused Wright some anxiety as to his fulfilment of the bond:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have just received a letter from Mr. Tate of Liverpool, where he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>tells me M<sup>r.</sup> Burdett has sold up his goods and is off. M<sup>rs.</sup>
Burdett and her dear Miss Fredried are gone into lodgings, over head
and ears in debt. I stand no chance of being paid at present&mdash;well,
if ever; wou’d therefore have you write immediately to Lord Ferrers
and tell him how things stand between me and Burdett, that he has not
paid a farthing of principal or interest of the four score pounds his
Lordship was bound for, w<sup>ch</sup> I lent him in the year ’60 or ’61, that
he takes no notice of the letters I have wrote him lately concerning
the debt, must therefore look to his Lordship for it. When you write to
his Lordship send the amount of principal and interest, and desire him
to pay it as soon as he conveniently can. If it is not convenient for
him to pay the whole, perhaps it will be prudent to take the interest
only, as that will secure y<sup>e</sup> debt, and prolong the limited time for
payment. M<sup>r.</sup> Fallows will advise you, give my respects to that
family. Tell his Lordship I would not apply to him at this time for y<sup>e</sup>
money was I not much distressed for it, travelling is very expensive.”</p>

<p>On the back of the bond, in Wright’s handwriting, is the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“August the 23, 1776.</p>

<p class="left3">“Memo. This day the Earl Ferrers accepted a
bill drawn by me for Eighty Pounds, which when paid will be in
full for the principal of this Bond.”</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="smcap">Extract From “Wine and Walnuts.” By Pine.</h3>

<p>“Wright was celebrated for scenes that represented the effects of
fire subjects, which he painted with more truth to nature than even
Schalken, so far-famed.”</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Supper at Mortimer’s.</h3>

<p>“Upon my word, a delicate little hen turkey; what, a Christmas present
already! This turkey is from my old fellow-’prentice, Joe Wright,”
said Mortimer,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> “who never forgets us at Christmas. Poor Joe,
the valetudinarian! I’d be sworn he procured one of the least in
all Derby out of sheer compassion to our evil habits. He knows we
always dress his Christmas turkey for supper, and he has generally a
hint by way of postscript to his letters, touching the prevalence of
apoplexy. Now Master Joe was one of your water-gruel disciples when
we were youngsters together at Hudson’s; and I would wager ten pounds
to a crown piece, he is just now sitting, Peter Grievous, over that
wishy-washy, tasteless, humdrum, drivelling dish, and calling to old
Nan Watkins&mdash;‘Nanny, have you any nice live coals? Do, pray, let me
have my bed warmed.’ Are you a supper eater, Mister Gibbon?”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> “No,
Mister Mortimer; I am a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> man, and a bit of a valetudinarian like
your friend Mister Wright.” “And a water-gruel eater, I presume?” said
Mortimer. “Yes, indeed,” said Gibbon, smiling; “though in truth, I do
not know that I am at all the better for these scrupulosities in diet.”</p>

<p>This playfully overdrawn picture of Wright’s habits was probably
written before Wright went to Italy. Wright was of very temperate and
abstemious habits, which, unfortunately, cannot be said of Mortimer.</p>

<p>Dr. Wolcott, as Peter Pindar, in one of his Poems, called Mr.
Wright’s moons silver sixpences; upon being remonstrated with, he
said he had not seen any of his moonlights, but supposed the moon
must look like a sixpence. Probably this was the passage that Mr.
Holland disliked, when he wrote the following lines, had them printed,
and pasted them over the passage in his volume of Peter Pindar’s
Poems&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Holland showed the book to a friend, who exclaimed, “Well done,
Peter, I did not think he would have done Wright so much justice.”</p>

<p>The celebrated Dr. Darwin, who was on friendly terms with Wright,
was often consulted by him, respecting his “imaginary complaints,” as
the Doctor unjustly called them; and on one occasion told him, “he
had but one thing more to recommend, and that was what he would not
give, but he thought it would be to his advantage to be engaged in a
vexatious lawsuit.” The Poet Doctor alludes to Wright in his “Botanic
Garden,” Canto I., line 175, in the following lines&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="smcap">From the “Memoirs of the life of Dr. Darwin.” By
Anna Seward.</h3>

<p>“In the course of the year 1770, Mr. Day stood for a full-length
picture<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> to Mr. Wright, of Derby. A strong likeness, and a dignified
portrait were the result. Drawn as in the open air, the surrounding
sky is tempestuous, lurid, and dark. He stands leaning his left arm
against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> column inscribed to Hampden. Mr. Day looks upward as
enthusiastically meditating on the contents of a book, held in his
dropped right hand. The open leaf is the oration of that virtuous
patriot in the senate, against the grant of ship money demanded by King
Charles the First. A flash of lightning plays in Mr. Day’s hair, and
illuminates the contents of the volume. The poetic fancy and what were
<i>then</i> the politics of the original, appear in the choice of subject
and attitude. Dr. Darwin sat to Mr. Wright about the same period. The
result was a simply contemplative portrait<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> of the most perfect
resemblance.”</p>

<p>Miss Meteyard, in her life of Wedgwood, says in Vol. II., page
442:&mdash;“Wedgwood in the previous year (1778) had bespoken a picture
of Wright, of Derby, who, neglected by his countrymen ‘would,’ as
Wedgwood said, ‘starve as a painter if the Empress of Russia had not
some taste and sense to buy these pictures now, which we may wish the
next century to purchase again at treble the price she now pays for
them.’ Soon after this Wright tried enamel painting, and towards the
close of 1779 he promised to visit Etruria and ‘catch any help from
its fires;’ but it is not till subsequently that we hear of the fine
picture he painted for Wedgwood.”</p>

<p>Again, on page 508, Miss Meteyard writes:&mdash;“In 1784 Wright,
of Derby, painted for Wedgwood his celebrated picture of the Maid of
Corinth, as also a portrait which was probably that of the very friend
who had as far as possible replaced Bentley in his heart, Erasmus
Darwin. After some critical remarks on female drapery, Wedgwood, in
writing to the painter, said of the Maid of Corinth:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I do not say I am <i>satisfied</i> with the lover, but that I think it
excellent, I had almost said inimitable, &amp; I should quake for any
future touch of your pencil there. It is unfortunate, in my <i>opinion</i>,
that the maid shows so much of her back; but I give my <i>opinion</i> only,
with great diffidence and submission to your better judgment. In one
word, you have been so happy in your figure of the lover, that almost
any other must appear to disadvantage in so near a comparison. Make her
to please yourself, and I shall be perfectly satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Six years previously Wright had painted for Mr. Wedgwood one of his
most celebrated pictures. Writing to Bentley the latter says:&mdash;‘I
am glad to hear that Mr. Wright is in the land of the living. I should
like to have a piece of this gentleman’s art, but think Debutades’
daughter would be a more apropos subject for me than the Alchymist,
though my principal reason for having this subject would be a sin
against the costume. I mean the introduction of our vases into the
piece, for how could such fine things be supposed to exist in the
earliest infancy of the potter’s art? You know what I want, &amp; when
you see Mr. Wright again, I wish you would consult with him upon the
subject. Mr. Wright once began a piece in which our vases might be
introduced with the greatest propriety. I mean the handwriting upon the
Wall in the Palace of Belshazzar.’&mdash;Wedgwood to Bentley, May 5,
1778.”</p>

<p>Upon enquiry as to the present locality of the pictures Wright painted
for Wedgwood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> we regret to learn that they were all lost to the family
early in the present century. It appears that they were sent to some
person in London for Exhibition, or for the purpose of being cleaned,
and whilst there were distrained for rent. The pictures were dispersed
and beyond recall before the Wedgwoods could interfere.</p>

<p>One of these pictures, a “Portrait of Sir Richard Arkwright,” was some
years afterwards presented to the Manchester Royal Exchange by Edmund
Buckley, Esq., where it now hangs.</p>

<p>On page 26, mention has been made of the friendship which existed
between Wedgwood and Wright, exemplified by Wright giving a painting
“to his friend Jos. Wedgwood, the patron and encourager of living
artists.” This friendship and generosity Wedgwood emulated upon the
occasion of the marriage of Wright’s daughter, Anna Romana, to Mr.
Cade, by the gift of a dinner service of 150 pieces.</p>

<p class="left3">“I have repeatedly read your charming poem.
The subject you hold out for my pencil, as you have treated
it, is an excellent one; but how to paint a flaming sword
baffles my art. However, as soon as I find myself stout
enough, I intend to attack it. I admire the scenery. Would
it strengthen or weaken the character to lay it near the
sea, upon a rising ground, and through an opening among the
trees low in the picture to see the moon just rising above a
troubled sea? The point of time is when the sword is rising
out of the tomb, what kind of tomb should it be? To make it
a regular one would indicate Herver’s father had the usual
funeral rites performed, which the poem, I think, contradicts.

<p>“Towards the end of August, 1776, Hayley and Mrs. Hayley went to Derby
for the pleasure of congratulating their friend Dr. Beridge on a
most seasonable marriage, that restored him from a state of perilous
discomfort to health and happiness. This visit was productive of
various delights. Hayley not only sympathised in the happiness of the
restored Physician, but in the weeks that he passed under his friend’s
roof he had the gratification of cultivating an intimacy with Wright,
the admirable painter of Derby, who, having injured his health by
too assiduous application to his art, had great comfort in the kind
attention he received from the friendly physician, &amp; took a pleasure
in executing for Hayley two hasty portraits in chiaro-oscuro of Mrs.
Beridge &amp; her husband, after painting for the Doctor the Poet of Sussex
and his ‘Eliza.’”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The following is extracted from the “Life of Wm. Hayley, Esq.” by
John Johnson, LL.D., Rector of Welborne, in Norfolk:&mdash;“Hayley went to
Cambridge in 1763. Here he formed an intimate friendship with Thornton,
Beridge, &amp; Clyfford, whose custom it was to breakfast together in the
apartments of each other. Hayley devoted some months of the year 1772
to his highly-valued friend Beridge, who had settled as a physician at
Derby. Hayley then copied in water-colours two bold sketches of scenery
near Matlock, lent to him by the very amiable artist Wright, of Derby,
with whom he began this year an intimacy that lasted to the death of
the painter, who frequently in his letters consulted his friend of
Sussex on the subjects of his pencil.”</p>

<p>The following extract is from the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, “Memoirs, &amp;c., of
Wm. Hayley”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hayley’s son (Thomas Alphonso, the sculptor), was then in his
thirteenth year.... It had been Hayley’s first intention to educate his
son for the profession of physic, but many circumstances combined to
give him a strong inclination for that of the arts. During a visit to
Mrs. Hayley, Wright, of Derby, perceived in him so much aptitude for
painting, that he took pains in instructing him; and upon the report
of his progress, Flaxman wrote to his father, saying, ‘If you have
not quite determined to make him a physician, and if you think he has
talents for the Fine Arts, show yourself my friend indeed, and accept
my offer as frankly as I make it.’”</p>

<p>The offer was accepted, but this promising young artist died, after a
long illness, a few years later.</p>

<p>Extract from a letter from T. A. Hayley to his father, the
poet:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your letter to Mr. Wright, I delivered to his daughter, who happened
to be with us when it arrived, and he has been since so good as to give
me a few instructions in drawing.”</p>

<p>“A cordial friendship had long existed between Wright, the admirable
painter, of Derby, and the father of Alphonso; but the latter, in
writing to his friend, had only requested him to gratify the little
traveller with the permission of sometimes passing a leisure hour in
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> painting-room, and with the indulgence of seeing him exercise his
pencil. The amiable artist, with that warm benevolence which formed
a striking part of his character, went beyond the request of his old
friend, and being more and more pleased with the intelligence, spirit,
and docility of his little visitor, spontaneously bestowed on him such
repeated instructions, as perfectly awakened in him a passion and a
genius for art, which, being afterwards inspirited by the affectionate
encouragement of his father, of Romney, and of Flaxman, ultimately
changed his very early professional destination from medicine to
sculpture.”</p>

<p class="left3">“I am infinitely pleased with the first-fruits of the little

that we have ever received from him. Would to heaven I could
send him a good portion of health and spirits to attend your
interesting offering to the very amiable invalid. From all
of him I collect from Meyer, I fear his pencil has been very
inactive for some time. I always grieve when men of talents
are condemned by ill-health to involuntary indolence; and I
doubly grieve when that misfortune falls upon a friend whose
works I have often surveyed with delight.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The following letter relates to the picture of the “Alchymist,” now
belonging to the Derby Corporation Art Gallery, having been presented
to that Town as a memorial to the painter, by a few of his admirers, in
1883:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="smcap">“Dear Wright,</p>

<p class="left3">“Dr. Turner will in his letter be more particular than I
can possibly be on a subject to which I am a stranger. I
have conceived that the chemist should be sitting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> this
side the table, &amp; turning his head towards glass upon his
assistant exclaiming upon the first appearance of the luminous
exhalation from the Retort into receiver of the phenomenon.
The lamp is still under the influence of the blast of wind
remaining in the bellows below which the chemist has been
using in another process. Whether this idea of the flame will
in the least answer your purpose you alone can judge; you will
wonder when you are told that I am painting History without
figure, Landscape without trees, and Shipwreck without water.
Mrs. Burdett joins me in love, compliments, and everything
else to your Family.</p>

<p>From a letter on page 27, it appears that Wright took this picture with
him to Rome in 1774, where it was much admired.</p>

<p class="left3">“This morning I have sent off by Shawcross a case addressed to
you, containing the book of drawings after Mic. Angelo, and
a slight sketch of a wild scene which I painted some years
ago. I looked it up the other day, and if you think it worth a
place in your collection, please accept it with my esteem.</p>

<p>“The picture of the ‘Ponte Salerno’ is in such a state I shall
not be able to finish it at present. I retouched the sky some
time ago &amp; some other parts of the picture, &amp; the colours are
changed in a most abominable manner. One never can depend upon
fresh colours laid on old. I hope the little picture I have
sent you will not share the same fate. I have finished the
‘Storm’ except the figure of Antigonus. Your Brother Frank
seemed to like it much; indeed those who have seen it give it
the preference to the other. I have brought ye ship nearer,
which heightens the distress of the scene; and being much
larger, the masts go above the horizon, and make a ballance to
the other side of the picture.</p>

<p>“I am going to begin a cottage on fire for a Gentleman at
Bristol. He has offered me 50g<sup>s.</sup> to finish it highly. I
have also finished Tate’s ‘Moonlight,’ which is much admired.
I think I shall send it with the ‘Storm,’ not by way of
receiving the cash&mdash;for that I forbid&mdash;but to give you taste
and pleasure, for I flatter myself it will. Perhaps if he has
no place to hang it, you would give it house room till wanted.</p>

<p>“When I have thought a little more about manufacturing
pictures, and have digested a plan for such business, I shall
like it much, if I can get a sale for them. I have got two
or three on the stocks. The one is finished, the other far
advanced. The finished one is on a pannel, which I had by me,
but the smooth surface is not calculated for expedition. The
subject is ‘The Lake of Albano,’ sunset. Being done from one
pallet, there is great unity and harmony in the colouring.
When you have received the case, pray give me a line, for I
shall wish to know Mic. Angelo is safe in your possession.

a little property in, and have some thoughts of selling out.

<p>The Plates for Mic. Angelo here alluded to evidently refer to the
reproduction on copper of some of Wright’s sketches from the “Sistine
Chapel,” for we find Wright sending the sketches to Philips on Sep.
24th, 1792. There is in existence an impression from copper of one
of them, partly in aquatint, but whether from the hand of Wright or
Philips it is now impossible to say.</p>

I intend to send you next week for yours and my friends’

<p class="left3">“The day after you left us I set to work upon the picture of
‘Vesuvius,’ to remove the stiffness of the line of Lava made
across it (and which always dissatisfied me), by bringing
the trees more over it; but it would not do, for what proved
beneficial to the one was injurious to the other, by bringing
the groupe of trees &amp; rock much in a line. I have therefore
illuminated the ground, over which the Lava is about to pass,
very strongly, set fire to the plants &amp; raised a fresh smoke,
which here &amp; there passes across the lava, &amp; effectually
does the business. I have also increased the quantity &amp;
brilliancy of the smoke which arises from the upper surface of
the lava, so that the centre of the picture is more lighted
up, &amp; the general effect much improved. I have added the
forked lightning, which ever attends the dark smoke, &amp; which
increases the horror of the subject without disturbing the
effect; and on Tuesday I intended putting in ye figures &amp; the

<p>Hayley, in his life of Romney, thus alludes to Wright and his
engagement to paint for Boydell’s Shakspeare Gallery:&mdash;“Nov. 4<sup>th</sup>
1786. Mr. Josiah Boydell entertained the little party of friends to
the projected Gallery whom he has named in his preface to Shakspeare.
I wrote nothing in its favour except a brief sketch, and a letter
to engage my friend Wright, of Derby, to paint for the Gallery. My
application to Wright was made at the earnest desire of the Alderman.”</p>

<p>It appears that when the time for payment came, Wright was
dissatisfied with what Boydell offered to him for his picture of
“Ferdinand and Miranda.” Whether Hayley, the poet, who appears to have
been the go-between for the painter &amp; Boydell, placed the matter
before Wright in such a light that Boydell did not afterwards approve
of, it is now impossible to say. Wright, however, wrote the following
letter, which drew forth a characteristic reply from Boydell, who
adopts the usual plan of “abusing the plaintiff.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="r1">“Derby, July 26<sup>th</sup> 1789.</p>

<p class="left5 smcap">“To Alderman Boydell.</p>

<p class="smcap">“Sir,</p>

<p class="left3">“I understood by my friend M<sup>r.</sup> Hayley, that, forming a
Gallery of pictures from the works of Shakespeare was first
agitated in a private party, of which he was one; that the
artists were to be classed, ye first class to consist of Sir
Joshua, M<sup>r.</sup> West, M<sup>r.</sup> Romney, &amp;c., and your humble
servant; that those in that class were to have 300g<sup>s.</sup> a
picture, more or less, according to the size &amp; work they
might have in them; and that he was extremely happy to find
the artists had entered upon this most laudable work with a
spirit &amp; liberality that reflected the highest honour upon
them, resolving to sacrifice interest to fame. On these
grounds I began and finished my picture upon the largest size
then proposed. In the course of executing my picture, which,
through ill-health, was much protracted, I learnt from good
authority that ye original plan was quite deserted, that you
bought pictures of any size (and which were not designed for
the Gallery), and that the artists painted their subjects on
such sized canvasses as they thought proper, and made the best
terms they could with you. This, I have reason to believe, is
the case, from what I saw and heard when in Town last. Upon
your asking me when in the Gallery (together) what I expected
for my picture, I told you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> that, being very remote from the
scene of business, I was unacquainted with the prices you had
given; that I should leave myself to you, not doubting but
you would pay me as you had ye rest, upon which, pointing to
one of M<sup>r.</sup> Northcote’s pictures, you answered, We give him
25Og<sup>s.</sup> And, pray, said I, what do you give to M<sup>r.</sup> West
for his? Oh, replied you, was I to pay all ye artists as I
have done M<sup>r.</sup> West, I might soon shut up the Gallery. I
felt much mortified at this unworthy treatment, for such I
cannot but think it, and left you.</p>

<p>“Now, Sir, I knew at the time, and have been confirmed in it
since, that you gave Sir Joshua 5OOg<sup>s</sup> for his small picture,
and a very considerable fee besides; also, that you gave
M<sup>r.</sup> West 5OOg<sup>s</sup> for his picture, and yet you were paving
the way to offer me a much less sum. Is not my picture as
large as M<sup>r.</sup> West’s? Has it not equal, nay, more, work
in it? Is it not as highly finished? And has not the public
spoken as well of it? Then why should you attempt to make a
difference in our price? Till you can give me a satisfactory
reason why I should take less, I shall certainly expect the
same. Had the work been carried on by the artists, with that
generous and laudable spirit which my friend Hayley held out
to me, I would have scorned to have been behind the most
liberal of them; but for me alone to adhere to the first plan
would be the highest folly, as I should thereby not only lose
the pecuniary advantage, but endanger my reputation, a point
which I consider as of far greater moment.</p>

<p>“I mentioned the circumstances to some of my friends in Town,
&amp; to others since my return into the country, and they all
agree that I have strong reasons to complain of your treatment.</p>

thought I was somewhat acquainted with.</p>

<p>“You begin your letter by telling me that you understood that
I had classed the Painters according to their rank, and you
gave me a list of the first class, in which you place your
own name. Now, Sir, I never presumed to class the Painters. I
leave that to the public, to whose opinion and judgment I bow
with great reverence &amp; respect.</p>

<p>“At the same time I am free to confess that had I ever
presumed to have classed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> historical painters of this
country, perhaps M<sup>r.</sup> Wright’s name would not have stood
exactly where he has been pleased to place it himself.</p>

<p>“In the line of landscape, I confess it would have been a
different consideration.</p>

<p>“I find it would be too tedious to go through all the
ridiculous assertions that your very extraordinary Letter
contains. I shall therefore leave you to enjoy your notions,
however unfounded, and proceed immediately to business. I
never offered you any specific price for your picture. You
asked me what I had given for pictures of that size. I told
you the prices. You knew that 300 guineas was the utmost
stipulated sum, and, in one word, Sir, I will not give you any
more.</p>

<p>“And this I offer, not so much for the merits of the picture,
as that you nor no man may have reason to complain of my
want of liberality. You are, indeed, the first that ever has
complained on this subject, with what justice I leave the
world to judge. When I look at the merits of the picture, it
deserves no such sum; for however excellent the landscape part
of it may be, the figures are very faulty, and so much out of
drawing, that it will give no little trouble to correct it for
the engravers.</p>

<p>“As to whatever prices I have given, or may hereafter give
to any artist, in this or any other undertaking, I shall
certainly not consult Mr. Wright, and his attempting to dictate
to me on this subject is perfectly ridiculous.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the Alderman’s disparaging remarks, Wright painted two
other Shaksperian subjects, viz.: “The Tomb Scene in Romeo &amp; Juliet,”
and another of the “Storm,” with Antigonus pursued by a bear. The
former he never sold; the latter was purchased by Mr. Henry Philips.</p>

<p>Reference to these two pictures will be found in the following
correspondence:&mdash;</p>

<p class="smcap">“My dear Friend,</p>

<p class="left3">“I cannot stomach the application you wish me to make to him,
to come forward in my defence. Nor if I could, do I think it
would be of any use. Long, who, our friend Tate knows, is his
most intimate friend, &amp; whose judgment he holds in the first
rank, is intimately connected with the proprietors of the
work. Therefore, there is but little room to hope he would do
anything to serve me, that would in any wise injure a work
they themselves were the first planners of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am extremely obliged to you for the very flattering account
you have sent me. Things seem to work to our wishes, &amp; the
Alderman’s conduct will, I hope, soon be completely dissected.
I much wonder that Vasari has not appeared again ere now.
Perhaps he is intimidated. There appeared an odd paragraph in
one of ye papers a few posts ago: ‘The Prince of Pick-pockets
has given instructions to his attorney to prosecute a printer
for a libel on his character.’ As yet nothing has appeared
that will come under that denomination, <i>I hope</i>.</p>

<p>“I would most willingly write to M<sup>r.</sup> Heath respecting
plates being made from the two pictures, but I hardly know
what to propose to him; &amp; if, on account of the Picture of
‘Romeo &amp; Juliet,’ which has been so much decry’d, he should
have objections, it might embarrass him to decline it to
me. You have had so much trouble on my account, I really am
sorry to ask you to write a short letter to sound him in the
business; but he would be more explicit to you than me.</p>

<p class="smcap">“My dear Friend,</p>

<p class="left3">“The two pictures I exhibited last year in the R. Academy of
‘Romeo &amp; Juliet’ and Antigonus in the ‘Storm,’ were certainly
painted too dark, sad emblems of my then gloomy mind. I
have simplified the back ground of the former, enlarged the
parts, and thrown more light into the Tomb, so that Julia is
bright without being a spot; &amp; the picture of the ‘Storm,’ I
have near gone over the whole; rendering the parts clear &amp;
distinct, without weakening the character of Gloominess, and,
if a man may be allowed to judge &amp; speak of his own works,
they are much improved indeed. I wish Heath was to see ’em
now. I think he would like them, &amp; perhaps indulge us with
plates from them. I have a strange wish to see them well
engraved as they are, though unworthy of adding to Boydell’s
collection. I intended to have exhibited them at the Lyceum,
but they<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> have quarrelled amongst themselves and don’t
make one. Do you think Macklin would hang them in his room
a month or two, for I wish to have them better seen by the
publick than they have been. I communicate this to you to
judge of, because I well know you regard both my interests
&amp; honour. I have heard nothing from Macklin respecting my
painting for him. Tom Tate some time ago told me that Rogers,
of Liverpool, who is concerned in the work, asked him if he
thought, upon proper application being made, I would undertake
any subjects, for it was much their wishes that I should be
concerned. Macklin used me querely in his first scheme, &amp; his
application, if he does not wish to engage me, will now come
with an ill grace.</p>

<p class="smcap">Death of Mrs. Wright.&mdash;Removes to Queen Street, Derby.&mdash;Wright’s
Last Illness and Death.&mdash;Mr. J. Leigh Philips on the Character of
Wright.&mdash;Sale of Wright’s Pictures in London and Derby.&mdash;Letters from

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-o.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">On August 19<sup>th</sup> 1790, Mrs. Wright died of consumption, aged 41. This
loss inflicted a crushing domestic blow to her husband, whose health
now began seriously to fail, and from his MS. Book we are enabled by
the following receipt to fix the time when Wright left St. Helen’s
house (which was soon after pulled down), and by the name of the owner
of the property, Mr. Bainbrigge, we are enabled to identify the house
in which Wright resided down to the time of his death. The receipt is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left5">“May 1, 1793. Settled with M<sup>r</sup> Wright for half a year’s rent (Twenty
pounds) due Lady Day last.</p>

<p class="r1">“THOMAS BAINBRIGGE, Jun.”</p>

<p>The house is No. 26, in Queen Street, and is the first house in the
Parish of St. Alkmund&mdash;St. Michael’s being the adjoining parish. The
Family Vault was in St. Michael’s Church, but we find the Painter’s
family are interred in the church of the parish in which they lived.
His niece, Miss Wright, says:&mdash;“He removed to a house in Queen
Street, near to St. Alkmund’s Ch.; there the windows all looked into
the street, or upon buildings at the back part. The gardens being
beyond them, it was a dull prospect for him.” The house was roomy and
substantial, with a large garden, which in Wright’s time would be open
to the Cherry Orchard, now Orchard Street. The premises now open into
Chapel Street. This house afterwards became the post office, until the
year 1840, and is now in the occupation of Mr. Allen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The buildings appear to be in much the same state now as they were
at that time. Some outbuildings obstruct the view of the garden, an
archway giving the only glimpse of what was then open country, and
this peep was obtained by looking through a very pretty wrought iron
gate, no doubt from the hammer and anvil of Bakewell, who has left many
examples of his art and skill in the town and neighbourhood. A drawing
of the gate is here given, as it is worthy of preservation.</p>

<p>During the latter part of 1795 he became too ill to use his
pencil, and when his first grandchild was born in 1796, he talked
of introducing her in an unfinished portrait of her mother, in the
place of a music book, but the picture was left unaltered, as were
the portraits of his brother and his wife. He was so pleased with his
brother’s portrait at the first sitting, that he said “he should be
afraid of touching it again, lest the likeness should not be so good,”
and so it remained.</p>

  </div>

<p class="p2">In the month of May, 1797, he took to his bed; about this time his nose
bled to such a degree as to prevent his lying down, and from the feeble
state he was in, he had not strength to hold up his head for long
together. A broad ribbon was therefore tied to each side of the head
of the bed, upon which he rested his chin, and this simple contrivance
afforded him great relief. His sufferings, from a complication of
diseases, were very great, and he gradually became weaker. His daughter
Harriet attended him night and day during this his last illness, and on
the afternoon of the 29th of August, 1797, he expressed his pleasure
at having those around him he had always loved. About two hours before
he died, his friend, Mr. Tate, of Liverpool, having come to Derby, was
anxious to see him, and was admitted. Wright seemed pleased to see his
old friend, though he could scarcely articulate, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> he drew with his
fingers upon the sheet, as if expressive of the pleasure they formerly
enjoyed together in following that pursuit. He was buried on September
1st, 1797, in St. Alkmund’s Church, and the following inscription was
placed on a tablet<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> erected to his memory:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Jno. Leigh Philips, who wrote an account<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> of Wright shortly after his death, thus
writes of him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In his person he was rather above the middle size, and when young was
esteemed a very handsome man; his company was then much courted on
account of his pleasing vivacity and convivial habits; his eyes were
prominent and very expressive; in his manners he was mild, unassuming,
modest to an extreme, generous and full of sensibility, with the
perfect carriage of a gentleman; honourable and punctual in all his
transactions, he entertained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> most utter contempt for everything
like meanness or illiberality; and his good heart felt but too
poignantly for the misconduct of others.</p>

<p>“I may truly observe of him that he stedfastly acted on the principle
of always continuing to learn; from conversation, from examining
pictures, and, above all, from the study of nature, he was constantly
endeavouring to advance in the knowledge of his art; and to this
habit, as wise as it was modest, of considering himself through life
as a learner, no small share of his excellence may be ascribed. This
disposition was naturally attended with a candid readiness to adopt,
from the practice of other artists, new modes of proceeding, when they
appeared to him rational, and to make trial in studies on a small scale
of such as seemed in a tolerable degree promising.</p>

<p>“We shall conclude our account of Mr. Wright, in his private capacity
as a man, with observing that he repeatedly evinced much liberality,
by giving valuable pictures to individuals among his private friends,
or to persons to whom he thought himself obliged. In various instances
these gifts were <i>manifestly</i> disinterested; and they were always
conferred in a very pleasing manner, which declined rather than sought
the expression of gratitude.</p>

<p>“In addition to the character which he merits for the executive part
of his art, it is pleasing to record, that in his works the attention
is ever directed to the cause of virtue: that his early historical
pictures consist of subjects either of rational or moral improvement,
and he has succeeded admirably in arresting the gentler feelings of
humanity, for what eye or heart ever remained unmoved at the sight
of ‘Maria,’ Sterne’s ‘Captive,’ or the ‘Dead Soldier.’ In his works
‘not one immoral, one corrupted thought’ occurs to wound the eye of
delicacy, or induce a wish that so exquisite a pencil had not found
employment on more worthy subjects. His pictures may be considered as
the reflexion of his own delicate mind, and will be ranked by posterity
as treasures worthy the imitation of succeeding generations.”</p>

<p>The following letter from Mr. Philips to Dr. Wright is of interest:&mdash;</p>

were printed in London, &amp; I had no proof-sheet sent down. I
will thank you to present a copy to Mr. Holland when you have
an opportunity, with my respectful compliments. I have only
to lament my inability to do justice to the character of my
much-valued friend, as it requires abilities much beyond my
scope to point out the beauties of his works, which go far
beyond every modern effort of art, &amp; I do not expect to live

<p>Mr. J. Holland, of Ford Hall, one of Wright’s executors, attended the
sale at Christie’s, and on his return wrote the following quaint letter
to Dr. Wright, the artist’s brother:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="r1">“Ford, Aug<sup>t</sup> 11<sup>th</sup> 1801.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="left3">“On the 14<sup>th</sup> July &amp; at 4 o’clock in the morning, M<sup>rs.</sup>
Holland and myself passed through Derby on our return from
full ten weeks busling in noisy London. While the chaise was
preparing at Derby, I could not forbear viewing the outside
of your habitation, and wishing that the hour had been more
seasonable that I might have seen how you all would have
admired the Country Squire returned, and that you in your turn
might have had an opportunity to have discovered the vast
improvements I had made in Town manners, &amp;c., &amp;c. I had also
with me your Brother’s drawings from Michael Angelo, which I
wanted much to have left with you. They are, however, very
safe here. I was not able to forward the disposal of them,
tho’ I showed them to several artists, who commended them
very highly. They were all of opinion that they should have
been sold with the pictures. Do you remember Dr. Bates, who
many years ago lived in your Town, and removed from thence
to Aylesbury. Having been a long time in Rome, he knew the
subjects perfectly, and thought them very fine studies. I want
much to come to Derby, but cannot say when at present. I have
very fine impressions both of Sir Richd. Arkwright and the
‘Tempest,’ which I trust to convey to those they are intended
for in due time. I can say with my whole heart, that there was
not a landscape in the Exhibition that could be compared to
what used to be the production of your Brother’s pencil. But
this I thought ill-manners to advance in London. The artists,
indeed, I must say, whom I conversed with, were by no means
niggardly in their commendations of M<sup>r.</sup> Wright’s works.
There were at the Exhibition some fine coloured drawings,
particularly by Turner, who appears to be a very rising
genius. Sir W. Beechy, Hopner, &amp; Lawrence seem all three
pretty near an equality. I shall leave all my rare anecdotes
till I meet the worthy circle, and then you shall be told the
wonders &amp; no wonders that occurred to the Derbyshire man’s
visit to London after 33 years’ absence. My kind regards and
wishes to you and yours, and also at Spondon. The accounts,
&amp;c., shall come, when the bearer will be yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="r1">“J. HOLLAND.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be noticed that the pictures were nearly all bought by private
persons, and not by dealers; also that several pictures were “bought
in” at the sale at Christie’s in 1801, which were afterwards sold in
Derby, in 1810, at considerably enhanced prices. The following is a
copy of the catalogue, the original being in the Mayer Collection:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="r1">“Matlock Old Bath, Sep. 3<sup>rd</sup> 1797.</p>

<p class="left5 smcap">“To Mr. Wright, Surgeon, Irongate, Derby.</p>

<p class="smcap">“Sir,</p>

<p class="left3">“On passing through Derby, on Thursday last, I was on the
point of sending a servant to your brother’s, for the purpose
of making enquiries concerning him (meaning to go afterwards
myself, if his health admitted), when I heard with much
concern of his death. I feel sincere regret for a friend whom
I had long known and valued highly. Mrs. Gisborne &amp; myself, on
our return through Derby yesterday, would have been glad to
send our enquiries to Mr. Wright’s, but I was doubtful whether
it might not then be premature to do so. I will therefore
trouble you to express, at a proper opportunity, to Mrs. Cade
&amp; the rest of the family, our concern for their loss, and our
sincere wishes for their health.</p>

<p class="left4">“I am, Sir,</p>

<p class="left2">“Your faithful &amp; obedient servant,</p>

<p class="r1">“THOS. GISBORNE.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="p2">With these notices of the death of Wright, and the subsequent sale
of his pictures, my task is ended.</p>

<p>As the materials at my command have enabled me, I have striven to
present a faithful record of his artistic and private life. As
an artist, his genius was recognised in his own day; and it is
satisfactory to know that his industrious pencil provided an ample
income, and enabled him to realise a very sufficient competence for the
years when age and infirmity grew upon him. But there were drawbacks
to his attainment of greater fame and honours. He was a man of great
sensitiveness, and of strong domestic feelings and habits. His retiring
disposition, and the depressing maladies from which he suffered during
many years of his life, indisposed him both mentally and physically
for a residence in London, where an active life would have opened
out to him more extended patronage and consequent advancement in his
profession. As a man, the perusal of much private correspondence in
addition to that here published, has led me to form a high estimate of
his character. Loving in his family relationships, he was a faithful
and generous friend, and of large sympathies.</p>

<p>His private life reflects as great honour on his name, as do his works
on his artistic repute. The latter his own hand has imperishably handed
down to us, and his memory may well be cherished as one who has shed
undying lustre on his native town.</p>

<p>The following interesting Memoranda are taken from Wright’s MS. Book:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="sm">

<p>“Bessy Fritch, at the Green Dragon, a pretty little girl of
the delicate kind.”</p>

<p>“Nancy Nudal, in the Full Street, a pretty little girl.”</p>

<p>“Nancy Mellers, upon the Nun’s Green, against Haslam’s, a
pretty middle-sized girl.”</p>

<p>“Jno. Fletcher, of Osmaston, an old bald-headed man.”</p>

<p>It is very probable that Fletcher sat to Wright for the six
studies of an old man’s head which he painted, five of which
were exhibited in the Derby Art Gallery in 1883.</p>

He also owes me twenty pounds for my journey to Wakefield,

<p>There are several other Minor Prints after him. Also two very fine
Mezzo Prints, scarce, 2 ft. 6½ in. × 2 ft. 2 in. of a Boy and a Girl
with a Bladder, and Two Girls with a Lighted Stick, with the name of W.
Tate, pinxit (a friend of Wright’s), which is evidently an error, as it
is known that Wright did paint these two pictures, and it is presumed
that Mr. Tate had them engraved, hence the error.</p>

<p>A Portrait of the artist, engraved by Blake, was used as a frontispiece
to J. Leigh Philips’ article on Wright, in the “Monthly Magazine,” of
Sept. 1797. Blake engraved his plate from an etching by Wright himself,
and of which only one copy is now known to exist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The celebrated Engraving, “The Fishery,” engraved by
Woollett, often ascribed as after “Wright, of Derby,” was painted by a
Richard Wright, of Liverpool.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to know at what prices the fine Mezzotint
Prints were published, and the following list is copied from a
bill for Prints, receipted by W. Pether:&mdash;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
